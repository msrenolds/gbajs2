Roberts, PhD\n", "Forty-four years ago, the United States and the conservative movement were in dire straits. ", "Both had been betrayed by the Washington establishment and were uncertain whom to trust. ", "Both were internally splintered and strategically adrift. ", "Worse still, at that moment of acute vulnerability and division, we found ourselves besieged by existential adversaries, foreign and domestic. ", "The late 1970s were by any measure a historic low point for America and the political coalition dedicated to preserving its unique legacy of human flourishing and freedom. ", "Today, America and the conservative movement are enduring an era of division and danger akin to the late 1970s. ", "Now, as then, our political class has been discredited by wholesale dishonesty and corruption. ", "Look at America under the ruling and cultural elite today: ", "Inflation is ravaging family budgets, drug overdose deaths continue to escalate, and children suffer the toxic normalization of transgenderism with drag queens and pornography invading their school libraries. ", "Overseas, a totalitarian Communist dictatorship in Beijing is engaged in a strategic, cultural, and economic Cold War against America\u2019s interests, values, and people\u2014all while globalist elites in Washington awaken only slowly to that growing threat. ", "Moreover, low-income communities are drowning in addiction and government dependence. ", "Contemporary elites have even repurposed the worst ingredients of 1970s \u201cradical chic\u201d to build the totalitarian cult known today as \u201cThe Great Awokening.\u201d ", "And now, as then, the Republican Party seems to have little understanding about what to do. ", "Most alarming of all, the very moral foundations of our society are in peril. ", "Yet students of history will note that, notwithstanding all those challenges, the late 1970s proved to be the moment when the political Right unified itself and the country and led the United States to historic political, economic, and global victories. ", "The Heritage Foundation is proud to have played a small but pivotal role in that story. ", "It was in early 1979\u2014amid stagflation, gas lines, and the Red Army\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan, the nadir of Jimmy Carter\u2019s days of malaise\u2014that Heritage launched the Mandate for Leadership project. ", "We brought together hundreds of conservative scholars and academics across the conservative movement. ", "Together, this team created a 20-volume, 3,000-page governing handbook containing more than 2,000 conservative policies to reform the federal government and rescue the American people from Washington dysfunction. ", "It was a promise from the conservative movement to the country\u2014confident, specific, and clear. ", "Mandate for Leadership was published in January 1981\u2014the same month Ronald Reagan was sworn into his presidency. ", "By the end of that year, more than 60 percent of its recommendations had become policy\u2014and Reagan was on his way to ending stagflation, reviving American confidence and prosperity, and winning the Cold War. ", "The bad news today is that our political establishment and cultural elite have once again driven America toward decline. ", "The good news is that we know the way out even though the challenges today are not what they were in the 1970s. ", "Conservatives should be confident that we can rescue our kids, reclaim our culture, revive our economy, and defeat the anti-American Left\u2014at home and abroad. ", "We did it before and will do it again. ", "As Ronald Reagan put it: ", "Freedom is a fragile thing and it\u2019s never more than one generation away from extinction. ", "It is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation[.]1 ", "This is the duty history has put before us and the standard by which our generation of conservatives will be judged. ", "And we should not want it any other way. ", "The legacy of Mandate for Leadership, and indeed of the entire Reagan Revolution, is that if conservatives want to save the country, we need a bold and courageous plan. ", "This book is the first step in that plan. ", "THE CONSERVATIVE PROMISE\n", "This volume\u2014The Conservative Promise\u2014is the opening salvo of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, launched by The Heritage Foundation and our many partners in April 2022. ", "Its 30 chapters lay out hundreds of clear and concrete policy recommendations for White House offices, Cabinet departments, Congress, and agencies, commissions, and boards. ", "Just as important as the scope of The Conservative Promise\u2019s recommendations is the breadth of its authorship. ", "This book is the product of more than 400 scholars and policy experts from across the conservative movement and around the country. ", "Contributors include former elected officials, world-renowned economists, and veterans from four presidential Administrations. ", "This is an agenda prepared by and for conservatives who will be ready on Day One of the next Administration to save our country from the brink of disaster. ", "The Heritage Foundation is once again facilitating this work. ", "But as our dozens of partners and hundreds of authors will attest, this book is the work of the entire conservative movement. ", "As such, the authors express consensus recommendations already forged, especially along four broad fronts that will decide America\u2019s future: ", "1. Restore the family as the centerpiece of American life and protect our children. ", "2. Dismantle the administrative state and return self-governance to the American people. ", "3. Defend our nation\u2019s sovereignty, borders, and bounty against global threats. ", "4. Secure our God-given individual rights to live freely\u2014what our Constitution calls \u201cthe Blessings of Liberty.\u201d ", "What makes these four pieces of the conservative promise so valuable to the next President is that they cut through superficial distractions and focus on the moral and foundational challenges America faces in this moment of history. ", "This was one of the secrets of conservatives\u2019 success in the Reagan Era, one our generation should emulate. ", "As in the late 1970s, Americans today experience the failures of political and cultural elites in countless ways: in the job market and in the grocery store checkout lines, on the streets and in our schools, in the media and within our institutions. ", "But in truth, these daily dysfunctions are not innumerable problems, but innumerable manifestations of a few core crises. ", "In 1979, the threats we faced were the Soviet Union, the socialism of 1970s liberals, and the predatory deviancy of cultural elites. ", "Reagan defeated these beasts by ignoring their tentacles and striking instead at their hearts. ", "His approach to the Cold War? ", "\u201cWe win and they lose.\u201d ", "His economic agenda? ", "The human dignity of work and its many rewards. ", "His platform in the culture wars? ", "The \u201ccommunity of values embodied in these words: family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom.\u201d ", "This book\u2014and Project 2025 as a whole\u2014will arm the next conservative President with the same kind of strategic clarity, but for a new age. ", "PROMISE #1: RESTORE THE FAMILY AS THE CENTERPIECE\nOF AMERICAN LIFE AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.\n", "The next conservative President must get to work pursuing the true priority of politics\u2014the well-being of the American family. ", "In many ways, the entire point of centralizing political power is to subvert the family. ", "Its purpose is to replace people\u2019s natural loves and loyalties with unnatu- ", "ral ones. ", "You see this in the popular left-wing aphorism, ", "\u201cGovernment is simply the name we give to the things we choose to do together.\u201d ", "But in real life, most of the things people \u201cdo together\u201d have nothing to do with government. ", "These are the mediating institutions that serve as the building blocks of any healthy society. ", "Marriage. ", "Family. Work. ", "Church. ", "School. ", "Volunteering. ", "The name real people give to the things we do together is community, not government. ", "Our lives are full of interwoven, overlapping communities, and our individual and collective happiness depends upon them. ", "But the most important community in each of our lives\u2014and the life of the nation\u2014is the family. ", "Today, the American family is in crisis. ", "Forty percent of all children are born to unmarried mothers, including more than 70 percent of black children. ", "There is no government program that can replace the hole in a child\u2019s soul cut out by the absence of a father. ", "Fatherlessness is one of the principal sources of American poverty, crime, mental illness, teen suicide, substance abuse, rejection of the church, and high school dropouts. ", "So many of the problems government programs are designed to solve\u2014but can\u2019t\u2014are ultimately problems created by the crisis of marriage and the family. ", "The world has never seen a thriving, healthy, free, and prosperous society where most children grow up without their married parents. ", "If current trends continue, we are heading toward social implosion. ", "Furthermore, the next conservative President must understand that using government alone to respond to symptoms of the family crisis is a dead end. ", "Federal power must instead be wielded to reverse the crisis and rescue America\u2019s kids from familial breakdown. ", "The Conservative Promise includes dozens of specific policies to accomplish this existential task. ", "Some are obvious and long-standing goals like eliminating marriage penalties in federal welfare programs and the tax code and installing work requirements for food stamps. ", "But we must go further. ", "It\u2019s time for policymakers to elevate family authority, formation, and cohesion as their top priority and even use government power, including through the tax code, to restore the American family. ", "Today the Left is threatening the tax-exempt status of churches and charities that reject woke progressivism. ", "They will soon turn to Christian schools and clubs with the same totalitarian intent. ", "The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors. ", "This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\u201cSOGI\u201d), diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists. ", "Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. ", "It has no claim to First Amendment protection. ", "Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. ", "Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. ", "Pornography should be outlawed. ", "The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. ", "Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. ", "And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered. ", "In our schools, the question of parental authority over their children\u2019s education is a simple one: ", "Schools serve parents, not the other way around. ", "That is, of course, the best argument for universal school choice\u2014a goal all conservatives and conservative Presidents must pursue. ", "But even before we achieve that long-term goal, parents\u2019 rights as their children\u2019s primary educators should be non-negotiable in American schools. ", "States, cities and counties, school boards, union bosses, princi pals, and teachers who disagree should be immediately cut off from federal funds. ", "The noxious tenets of \u201ccritical race theory\u201d and \u201cgender ideology\u201d should be excised from curricula in every public school in the country. ", "These theories poison our children, who are being taught on the one hand to affirm that the color of their skin fundamentally determines their identity and even their moral status while on the other they are taught to deny the very creatureliness that inheres in being human and consists in accepting the givenness of our nature as men or women. ", "Allowing parents or physicians to \u201creassign\u201d the sex of a minor is child abuse and must end. ", "For public institutions to use taxpayer dollars to declare the superiority or inferiority of certain races, sexes, and religions is a violation of the Constitution and civil rights law and cannot be tolerated by any government anywhere in the country. ", "But the pro-family promises expressed in this book, and central to the next conservative President\u2019s agenda, must go much further than the traditional, narrow definition of \u201cfamily issues.\u201d ", "Every threat to family stability must be confronted. ", "This resolve should color each of our policies. ", "Consider our approach to Big Tech. ", "The worst of these companies prey on children, like drug dealers, to get them addicted to their mobile apps. ", "Many Silicon Valley executives famously don\u2019t let their own kids have smart phones.", "2 ", "They nevertheless make billions of dollars addicting other people\u2019s children to theirs. ", "TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms are specifically designed to create the digital dependencies that fuel mental illness and anxiety, to fray children\u2019s bonds with their parents and siblings. ", "Federal policy cannot allow this industrial-scale child abuse to continue. ", "Finally, conservatives should gratefully celebrate the greatest pro-family win in a generation: overturning Roe v. Wade, a decision that for five decades made a mockery of our Constitution and facilitated the deaths of tens of millions of unborn children. ", "But the Dobbs decision is just the beginning. ", "Conservatives in the states and in Washington, including in the next conservative Administration, should push as hard as possible to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction in America. ", "In particular, the next conservative President should work with Congress to enact the most robust protections for the unborn that Congress will support while deploying existing federal powers to protect innocent life and vigorously complying with statutory bans on the federal funding of abortion. ", "Conservatives should ardently pursue these pro-life and pro-family policies while recognizing the many women who find themselves in immensely difficult and often tragic situations and the heroism of every choice to become a mother. ", "Alternative options to abortion, especially adoption, should receive federal and state support. ", "In summary, the next President has a moral responsibility to lead the nation in restoring a culture of life in America again. ", "PROMISE #2: DISMANTLE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE AND\nRETURN SELF-GOVERNANCE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n", "Of course, the surest way to put the federal government back to work for the American people is to reduce its size and scope back to something resembling the original constitutional intent. ", "Conservatives desire a smaller government not for its own sake, but for the sake of human flourishing. ", "But the Washington Establishment doesn\u2019t want a constitutionally limited government because it means they lose power and are held more accountable by the people who put them in power. ", "Like restoring popular sovereignty, the task of reattaching the federal government\u2019s constitutional and democratic tethers calls to mind Ronald Reagan\u2019s observation that \u201cthere are no easy answers, but there are simple answers.\u201d ", "In the case of making the federal government smaller, more effective, and accountable, the simple answer is the Constitution itself. ", "The surest proof of this is how strenuously and creatively generations of progressives and many Republican insiders have worked to cut themselves free from the strictures of the 1789 Constitution and subsequent amendments. ", "Consider the federal budget. ", "Under current law, Congress is required to pass a budget\u2014and 12 issue-specific spending bills comporting with it\u2014every single year. ", "The last time Congress did so was in 1996. ", "Congress no longer meaningfully budgets, authorizes, or categorizes spending. ", "Instead, party leaders negotiate one multitrillion-dollar spending bill\u2014several thousand pages long\u2014and then vote on it before anyone, literally, has had a chance to read it. ", "Debate time is restricted. ", "Amendments are prohibited. ", "And all of this is backed up against a midnight deadline when the previous \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill will run out and the federal government \u201cshuts down.\u201d ", "This process is not designed to empower 330 million American citizens and their elected representatives, but rather to empower the party elites secretly negotiating without any public scrutiny or oversight. ", "In the end, congressional leaders\u2019 behavior and incentives here are no different from those of global elites insulating policy decisions\u2014over the climate, trade, public health, you name it\u2014from the sovereignty of national electorates. ", "Public scrutiny and democratic accountability make life harder for policymakers\u2014so they skirt it. ", "It\u2019s not dysfunction; it\u2019s corruption. ", "And despite its gaudy price tag, the federal budget is not even close to the worst example of this corruption. ", "That distinction belongs to the \u201cAdministrative State,\u201d the dismantling of which must a top priority for the next conservative President. ", "The term Administrative State refers to the policymaking work done by the bureaucracies of all the federal government\u2019s departments, agencies, and millions of employees. ", "Under Article I of the Constitution, \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d ", "That is, federal law is enacted only by elected legislators in both houses of Congress. ", "This exclusive authority was part of the Framers\u2019 doctrine of \u201cseparated powers.\u201d ", "They not only split the federal government\u2019s legislative, executive, and judicial powers into different branches. ", "They also gave each branch checks over the others. ", "Under our Constitution, the legislative branch\u2014Congress\u2014is far and away the most powerful and, correspondingly, the most accountable to the people. ", "In recent decades, members of the House and Senate discovered that if they give away that power to the Article II branch of government, they can also deny responsibility for its actions. ", "So today in Washington, most policy is no longer set by Congress at all, but by the Administrative State. ", "Given the choice between being powerful but vulnerable or irrelevant but famous, most Members of Congress have chosen the latter. ", "Congress passes intentionally vague laws that delegate decision-making over a given issue to a federal agency. ", "That agency\u2019s bureaucrats\u2014not just unelected but seemingly un-fireable\u2014then leap at the chance to fill the vacuum created by Congress\u2019s preening cowardice. ", "The federal government is growing larger and less constitutionally accountable\u2014even to the President\u2014every year. ", "A combination of elected and unelected bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency quietly strangles domestic energy production through difficult-to-understand rulemaking processes; ", "Bureaucrats at the Department of Homeland Security, following the lead of a feckless Administration, order border and immigration enforcement agencies to help migrants criminally enter our country with impunity; ", "Bureaucrats at the Department of Education inject racist, anti-American, ahistorical propaganda into America\u2019s classrooms; ", "Bureaucrats at the Department of Justice force school districts to undermine girls\u2019 sports and parents\u2019 rights to satisfy transgender extremists; ", "Woke bureaucrats at the Pentagon force troops to attend \u201ctraining\u201d seminars about \u201cwhite privilege\u201d; and Bureaucrats at the State Department infuse U.S. foreign aid programs with woke extremism about \u201cintersectionality\u201d and abortion.", "3 ", "Unaccountable federal spending is the secret lifeblood of the Great Awokening. ", "Nearly every power center held by the Left is funded or supported, one way or another, through the bureaucracy by Congress. ", "Colleges and school districts are funded by tax dollars. ", "The Administrative State holds 100 percent of its power at the sufferance of Congress, and its insulation from presidential discipline is an unconstitutional fairy tale spun by the Washington Establishment to protect its turf. ", "Members of Congress shield themselves from constitutional accountability often when the White House allows them to get away with it. ", "Cultural institutions like public libraries and public health agencies are only as \u201cindependent\u201d from public accountability as elected officials and voters permit. ", "Let\u2019s be clear: ", "The most egregious regulations promulgated by the current Administration come from one place: the Oval Office. ", "The President cannot hide behind the agencies; as his many executive orders make clear, his is the responsibility for the regulations that threaten American communities, schools, and families. ", "A conservative President must move swiftly to do away with these vast abuses of presidential power and remove the career and political bureaucrats who fuel it. ", "Properly considered, restoring fiscal limits and constitutional accountability to the federal government is a continuation of restoring national sovereignty to the American people. ", "In foreign affairs, global strategy, federal budgeting and policymaking, the same pattern emerges again and again. ", "Ruling elites slash and tear at restrictions and accountability placed on them. ", "They centralize power up and away from the American people: to supra-national treaties and organizations, to left-wing \u201cexperts,\u201d to sight-unseen all-or-nothing legislating, to the unelected career bureaucrats of the Administrative State. ", "As monolithic as the Left\u2019s institutional power appears to be, it originates with appropriations from Congress and is made complete by a feckless President. ", "A conservative President must look to the legislative branch for decisive action. ", "The Administrative State is not going anywhere until Congress acts to retrieve its own power from bureaucrats and the White House. ", "But in the meantime, there are many executive tools a courageous conservative President can use to handcuff the bureaucracy, push Congress to return to its constitutional responsibility, restore power over Washington to the American people, bring the Administrative State to heel, and in the process defang and defund the woke culture warriors who have infiltrated every last institution in America. ", "The Conservative Promise lays out how to use many of these tools including: ", "how to fire supposedly \u201cun-fireable\u201d federal bureaucrats; ", "how to shutter wasteful and corrupt bureaus and offices; ", "how to muzzle woke propaganda at every level of government; ", "how to restore the American people\u2019s constitutional authority over the Administrative State; and how to save untold taxpayer dollars in the process. ", "Finally, the President can restore public confidence and accountability to our most important government function of all: national defense. ", "The American people desire a military full of highly skilled servicemen and women who can protect the homeland and our interests overseas. ", "The next conservative President must end the Left\u2019s social experimentation with the military, restore warfighting as its sole mission, and set defeating the threat of the Chinese Communist Party as its highest priority. ", "The next conservative President must possess the courage to relentlessly put the interests of the everyday American over the desires of the ruling elite. ", "Their outrage cannot be prevented; it must simply be ignored. ", "And it can be. ", "The Left derives its power from the institutions they control. ", "But those institutions are only powerful to the extent that constitutional officers surrender their own legitimate authority to them. ", "A President who refuses to do so and uses his or her office to reimpose constitutional authority over federal policymaking can begin to correct decades of corruption and remove thousands of bureaucrats from the positions of public trust they have so long abused. ", "PROMISE #3: DEFEND OUR NATION\u2019S SOVEREIGNTY,\nBORDERS, AND BOUNTY AGAINST GLOBAL THREATS.\n", "The United States belongs to \u201cWe the people.\u201d ", "All government authority derives from the consent of the people, and our nation\u2019s success derives from the character of its people. ", "The American people\u2019s right to rule ourselves is the obverse of our duty: ", "We cannot outsource to others our obligation to ensure the conditions that allow our families, local communities, churches and synagogues, and neighborhoods to thrive. ", "The buck stops with each of us, so each of us must have the freedom to pursue the good for ourselves and those entrusted to our care. ", "To most Americans, this is common sense. ", "But in Washington, D.C. and other centers of Leftist power like the media and the academy, this statement of basic civics is branded hate speech. ", "Progressive elites speak in lofty terms of openness, progress, expertise, cooperation, and globalization. ", "But too often, these terms are just rhetorical Trojan horses concealing their true intention\u2014stripping \u201cwe the people\u201d of our constitutional authority over our country\u2019s future. ", "America\u2019s corporate and political elites do not believe in the ideals to which our nation is dedicated\u2014self-governance, the rule of law, and ordered liberty. ", "They certainly do not trust the American people, and they disdain the Constitution\u2019s restrictions on their ambitions. ", "Instead, they believe in a kind of 21st century Wilsonian order in which the \u201cenlightened,\u201d highly educated managerial elite runs things rather than the humble, patriotic working families who make up the majority of what the elites contemptuously call \u201cfly-over country.\u201d ", "This Wilsonian hubris has spread like a cancer through many of America\u2019s largest corporations, its public institutions, and its popular culture. ", "Those who run our so-called American corporations have bent to the will of the woke agenda and care more for their foreign investors and organizations than their American workers and customers. ", "Today, nearly every top-tier U.S. university president or Wall Street hedge fund manager has more in common with a socialist, European head of state than with the parents at a high school football game in Waco, Texas. ", "Many elites\u2019 entire identity, it seems, is wrapped up in their sense of superiority over those people. ", "But under our Constitution, they are the mere equals of the workers who shower after work instead of before. ", "This is as it should and must be. ", "Intellectual sophistication, advanced degrees, financial success, and all other markers of elite status have no bearing on a person\u2019s knowledge of the one thing most necessary for governance: what it means to live well. ", "That knowledge is available to each of us, no matter how humble our backgrounds or how unpretentious our attainments. ", "It is open to us to read in the book of human nature, to which we are all offered the key just by merit of our shared humanity. ", "One of the great premises of American political life is that everyone who can read in that book must have a voice in deciding the course and fate of our Republic. ", "Progressive policymakers and pundits in America either fail to understand this premise or intentionally reject it. ", "They enthusiastically support supranational organizations like the United Nations and European Union, which are run and staffed almost entirely by people who share their values and are mostly insulated from the influence of national elections. ", "That\u2019s why they are eager for America to sign international treaties on everything from pharmaceutical patents to climate change to \u201cthe rights of the child\u201d\u2014and why those treaties invariably endorse policies that could never pass through the U.S. Congress. ", "Like the progressive Woodrow Wilson a century ago, the woke Left today seeks a world, bound by global treaties they write, in which they exercise dictatorial powers over all nations without being subject to democratic accountability. ", "That\u2019s why today\u2019s progressive Left so cavalierly supports open borders despite the lawless humanitarian crisis their policy created along America\u2019s southern border. ", "They seek to purge the very concept of the nation-state from the American ethos, no matter how much crime increases or resources drop for schools and hospitals or wages decrease for the working class. ", "Open-borders activism is a classic example of what the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer called \u201ccheap grace\u201d\u2014publicly promoting one\u2019s own virtue without risking any personal inconvenience.

", "(\u201cLearn to code!\u201d they would gloat.) ", "These were just the price of progress. ", "Engagement was at every step Beijing\u2019s project, not America\u2019s.

", "They stole our technology, spied on our people, and threatened our allies, all with trillions of dollars of wealth and military power financed by their access to our market.

", "One side of Big-Tech companies\u2019 business model is old-fashioned American competitiveness and world-changing technological innovation; but increasingly, that side of these businesses is overshadowed by their role as operatives in the lucrative employ of America\u2019s most dangerous international enemy. ", "If you want to understand the danger posed by collaboration between Big Tech and the CCP, look no further than TikTok. ", "The highly addictive video app, used by 80 million Americans every month and overwhelmingly popular among teenage girls, is in effect a tool of Chinese espionage. ", "The ties between TikTok and the Chinese government are not loose, and they are not coincidental. ", "The same can be observed of many U.S. colleges and universities.

", "Yet the federal bureaucracy has a mind of its own. ", "Federal employees are often ideologically aligned\u2014not with the majority of the American people\u2014but with one another, posing a profound problem for republican government, a government \u201cof, by, and for\u201d the people. ", "As Donald Devine, Dennis Kirk, and Paul Dans write in Chapter 3, \u201cAn autonomous bureaucracy has neither independent constitutional status nor separate moral legitimacy.\u201d ", "Byzantine personnel rules provide the bureaucrats with their chief means of self-protection. ", "What\u2019s more, knowledge of such rules is used to thwart the President\u2019s appointees and agenda. ", "As Devine, Kirk, and Dans write, \u201cManaging the immense bureaucracy of the federal government is impossible without an understanding of the key central personnel agencies and their governing laws and regulations.\u201d ", "Many of these laws and regulations governing a largely underworked, overcompensated, and unaccountable federal civilian workforce are so irrational that they would be comical in a less important context. ", "This is true whether it comes to evaluating employees\u2019 performance or hiring new employees. ", "Only in the federal government could an applicant in the hiring process be sent to the front of the line because of a \u201chistory of drug addiction\u201d or \u201calcoholism,\u201d or due to \u201cmorbid obesity,\u201d \u201cirritable bowel syndrome,\u201d or a \u201cpsychiatric disorder.\u201d ", "The next Administration should insist that the federal government\u2019s hiring, evaluation, retention, and compensation practices benefit taxpayers, rather than benefiting the lowest rung of the federal workforce. ", "In order to carry out the President\u2019s desires, political appointees must be given the tools, knowledge, and support to overcome the federal government\u2019s obstructionist Human Resources departments. ", "More fundamentally, the new Administration must fill its ranks with political appointees. ", "Devine, Kirk, and Dans observe that \u201cthe Trump Administration appointed fewer political appointees in its first few months in office\u201d than any other recent presidency. ", "This left career employees in charge in many places. ", "This can occur even after departments have been fully staffed with political appointees. ", "Vought writes that the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should establish a \u201creputation as the keeper of \u2018commander\u2019s intent,\u2019\u201d yet OMB is dominated by career employees who often try to overrule political appointees serving in the various executive departments. ", "Empowering political appointees across the Administration is crucial to a President\u2019s success. ", "Above all, the President and those who serve under him or her must be committed to the Constitution and the rule of law. ", "This is particularly true of a conservative Administration, which knows that the President is there to uphold the Constitution, not the other way around. ", "If a conservative Administration does not respect the Constitution, no Administration will. ", "In Chapter 1, former deputy chief of staff to the President Rick Dearborn writes that the White House Counsel \u201cmust take seriously the duty to protect the powers and privileges of the President from encroachments by Congress, the judiciary, and the administrative components of departments and agencies.\u201d ", "Equally important, the President must enforce the Constitution and laws as written, rather than proclaiming new \u201claw\u201d unilaterally.

", "Since the inaugural Administration of the late 18th century, citizens have chosen to devote both their time and their talent to defending and strengthening our nation by serving at the pleasure of the President. ", "Their shared patriotic endeavor has proven to be a noble one, not least because the jobs in what is now known as the White House Office (WHO) are among the most demanding in all of government. ", "The President must rely on the men and women appointed to the WHO.

", "The decisions that assistants and senior advisers make will directly impact the Administration, its legacy, and\u2014most important\u2014the fate of the country. ", "Their agenda must therefore be the President\u2019s agenda. ", "Choosing who will carry out that agenda on a daily basis is not only one of the first decisions a President makes in office, but also one of the most critical. ", "The tone and tempo of an administration are often determined on January 20. ", "CHIEF OF STAFF\n", "As with most of the positions that will be covered in this first chapter, the Chief of Staff is also an Assistant to the President.

It should be simple and contain clear lines of authority and responsibility to avoid conflicts. ", "It should also identify specific points of contact for each element of the government outside of the White House. ", "These contacts should include the White House Liaisons who are selected by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO). ", "Receiving guidance from the President, the chief endeavors to implement the President\u2019s agenda by setting priorities for the WHO. ", "This process begins by taking stock of the President\u2019s campaign promises, identifying current and prospective opportunities, and then delegating policy priorities among the departments and agencies of the Cabinet and throughout the three White House policy councils: ", "l The National Economic Council (NEC); ", "l The Domestic Policy Council (DPC); and ", "l The National Security Council (NSC). ", "The President is briefed on all of his policy priorities by his Cabinet and senior staff as directed by the chief. ", "The chief\u2014along with senior WHO staff\u2014maps out the issues and themes that will be covered daily and weekly. ", "The chief then works with the policy councils, the Cabinet, and the Office of Communications and Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to sequence and execute the rollout of policies and announcements. ", "White House Counsel and senior advisers and senior counselors are also intimately involved. ", "All senior staff report to the Chief of Staff, either directly or through his two or three deputies, unless the President determines that a particular Assistant to the President reports directly to him. ", "Most chiefs have interacted directly with Cabinet officers and a select number of direct reports. ", "In most cases, the direct reports to the chief are his two or three deputies, the Communications Director, PPO Director, White House Counsel, and senior advisers. ", "Occasionally, the Office of Public Liaison (OPL), the Cabinet Secretary, and Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) also report directly to the chief. ", "Usually, however, they report instead to a Deputy Chief of Staff. ", "The Chief of Staff\u2019s main challenge is time management. ", "His use of his deputies, meetings with senior staff, and direction provided to the WHO must all balance with the daily needs of the President. ", "A successful chief steers the West Wing using his management of and influence with the various individuals and entities around him. ", "It goes without saying that selecting the right person to be chief is vital. ", "DEPUTY CHIEFS OF STAFF\n", "In recent years, Presidents typically have appointed two Deputy Chiefs of Staff: a Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations and a Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. ", "There also have been other types of deputy chiefs whose roles have included, for example, overseeing strategy, planning, and implementation. ", "Chiefs of Staff have then occasionally appointed a principal Deputy Chief to be in charge of guiding decision-making, organizational structure, and information flow. ", "PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CHIEFS OF STAFF\n", "Not all Chiefs of Staff have tapped a principal deputy. ", "A major reason is that doing so adds another layer of command complexity. ", "When principal deputies have been installed, their roles have varied based on the needs of particular chiefs. ", "Most principal deputies have functioned as doorkeepers, sorting through action items, taking on those that can be handled at their own level, and passing up others that truly require the attention of the Chief of Staff or the President. ", "Principal deputies also have assumed control of the scheduling functions, normally under the operations deputy, and have worked directly with the policy councils at the direction of the Chief of Staff. ", "The OPL and Office of Political Affairs (OPA) also have reported to a principal deputy. ", "Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations. ", "The Deputy Chief\nof Staff for Management and Operations oversees the President\u2019s schedule and all logistical aspects of his movement within and outside of the White House (for example, both air travel on Air Force One and Marine One and ground transportation). ", "This deputy also interfaces directly with the Secret Service as well as the military offices tasked with keeping the President and his family safe. ", "In the past, this deputy has also worked with the NSC, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Intelligence Community and on advancing all foreign trips. ", "If their roles are separated from that of the policy deputy, this deputy should have a strong grasp of international affairs and robust foreign policy credentials. ", "This deputy further manages all facets of the working White House: technology, grounds management, support staff, personnel administration, and communications. ", "This individual therefore needs to be meticulous and ideally should possess a great deal of command-and-control experience. ", "Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. ", "In some Administrations, the functions of\nthe IGA, OPA, and OPL and other advisers within the WHO have fallen under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. ", "For conservatives, this arrangement could help to connect the WHO\u2019s outreach to political and external groups and be a strong conduit for state and local elected officials, state party organizations, and both grasstop and grassroots groups. ", "This deputy chief works directly with the Chief of Staff, Cabinet officers, and all three policy councils to support the development and implementation of the President\u2019s agenda. ", "This deputy chief should therefore have impressive policy credentials in the realms of economic, domestic, and social affairs. ", "SENIOR ADVISERS\n", "Presidents have surrounded themselves with senior advisers whose experience and interests are not necessarily neatly defined. ", "In recent Administrations, senior advisers have been appointed to offer broad guidance on political matters and communications issues; others have acted as \u201cczars\u201d for specific projects or policy areas. ", "The most powerful senior advisers frequently have had a long personal relationship with the President and often have spent a significant amount of time with him within and outside of the White House. ", "They have been asked not only to provide guidance on a variety of policy issues, but also to offer instruction on communicating with the American people and the media. ", "In a number of Administrations, new offices\u2014or \u201ccouncils\u201d\u2014have been created to support senior advisers. ", "For the most part, their functions have been duplicative or overlapping, as a result of which these offices have tended to be short-lived. ", "Even so, senior advisers should be provided the staff and resources that their portfolios require. ", "To ensure that senior advisers are effective, their portfolios must be clearly delineated and clearly communicated across the White House. ", "This too is a responsibility of the Chief of Staff. ", "OFFICE OF WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL\n", "The Office of White House Counsel provides legal guidance to the President and elements of the EOP on a host of issues, including presidential powers and privileges, ethics compliance, review of clemency applications, and judicial nominations. ", "The selection of White House Counsel is one of the most important decisions an incoming President will make. ", "The office is not designed to create or advance policies on its own initiative\u2014nor should it do so. ", "Rather, it is dedicated to guiding the President and his reports on how (within the bounds of the law) to pursue and realize the President\u2019s agenda. ", "While the White House Counsel does not serve as the President\u2019s personal attorney in nonofficial matters, it is almost impossible to delineate exactly where an issue is strictly personal and has no bearing on the President\u2019s official function. ", "The White House Counsel needs to be deeply committed both to the President\u2019s agenda and to affording the President proactive counsel and zealous representation. ", "That individual directly advises the President as he performs the duties of the office, and this requires a relationship that is built on trust, confidentiality, and candor. ", "The Office of White House Counsel is also responsible for ensuring that each component of the White House adheres to all applicable legal and ethical guidelines, which often requires ongoing training and monitoring to ensure compliance. ", "This means ensuring that White House staff regularly consult with office attorneys on required financial disclosures, received gifts, potential conflicts of interest, and other ethical concerns. ", "The Office of White House Counsel is the first line of defense for the EOP. ", "Its staff must take seriously the duty to protect the powers and privileges of the President from encroachments by Congress, the judiciary, and the administrative components of departments and agencies. ", "In addition to the White House Counsel, the office includes deputies, assistants, associates, and legal support staff. ", "The assistant and associate attorneys are often specialists in particular areas of the law and offer guidance to the EOP on issues related to national security, criminal law, environmental law, and a host of administrative and regulatory matters. ", "Attorneys working in the Office of White House Counsel serve as legal advisers to the White House policy operation by reviewing executive orders, agency regulations, and other policy-related functions. ", "Here again, subordinates should be deeply committed to the President\u2019s agenda and see their role as helping to accomplish the agenda through problem solving and advocacy. ", "They should not erect roadblocks out of an abundance of caution; rather, they should offer practical legal advice on how to promote the President\u2019s agenda within the bounds of the law. ", "The White House Counsel\u2019s office cannot serve as a finishing school to credential the next set of white-shoe law firm attorneys or federal judges in waiting who cabin their opinions for fear their elite credentials could be tarnished through a policy disagreement. ", "Rather, it should function more as an activist yet ethical plaintiffs\u2019 firm that advocates for its client\u2014the Administration\u2019s agenda\u2014within the limits imposed by the Constitution and the duties of the legal profession. ", "The Office of White House Counsel also serves as the primary gateway for communication between the White House and the Department of Justice (DOJ). ", "Traditionally, both the White House Counsel and the Attorney General have issued a memo requiring all contact between the two institutions to occur only between the Office of White House Counsel and the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General. ", "The next Administration should reexamine this policy and determine whether it might be more efficient or more appropriate for communication to occur through additional channels. ", "The White House Counsel also works closely with the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel to seek opinions on, for example, matters of policy development and the constitutionality of presidential power and privileges and with OLA and the DOJ Office of Legal Policy on presidential judicial nominees. ", "When a new President takes office, he will need to decide expeditiously how to handle any major ongoing litigation or other pending legal matters that might present a challenge to his agenda. ", "To offer guidance, the White House Counsel must get up to speed as quickly as possible on all significant ongoing legal challenges across the executive branch that might affect the new Administration\u2019s policy agenda and must be prepared at the outset of the Administration to present recommendations to the President, including recommendations for reconsidering or reversing positions of the previous Administration in any significant litigation. ", "This review will usually require consulting with the new political leadership at the Justice Department, including during the transition period. ", "No day is predictable at the White House. ", "Therefore, to handle the pace and volatility of affairs, the Office of White House Counsel must offer measured legal guidance in a timely manner. ", "This often means forgoing law review\u2013style memos about esoteric legal concepts and instead quickly providing high-level yet incisive guidance. ", "Due to evolving world events, domestic affairs, and political pressures, the office often faces legal questions for which there may not be a wealth of precedent. ", "Attorneys in the Office of White House Counsel must therefore work collaboratively within the White House and the Department of Justice, relying on each other as a team, to ensure that proper legal guidance is delivered to the President. ", "The President should choose a White House Counsel who is well-versed in the Constitution, administrative and regulatory law, and the inner workings of Congress and the political process. ", "Instead of choosing a specialist, the President should hire a counsel with extensive experience with a wide range of complex legal subjects.

", "The office is similar to a military commander\u2019s adjutant as it is responsible for fielding and managing a vast amount of information at the top of its organization. ", "This includes information on its way into the Oval Office as well as information flowing out from the Oval Office. ", "Because of its gatekeeping function, the position of Staff Secretary is one of extreme trust, and the individual who possesses it should be vetted to work as an \u201chonest broker\u201d in the President\u2019s service. ", "The Office of the Staff Secretary has been described as the last substantive control point before papers reach the Oval Office. ", "A great deal of information is headed toward the Oval Office at any moment. ", "This includes presidential decision memos; bills passed by Congress (which may be accompanied by signing or veto statements); and briefing books, reading materials, samples of constituent mail, personal mail, and drafts of speeches. ", "The Staff Secretary makes certain that these materials are complete, well-ordered, and up to date before they reach the President. ", "This necessarily means that the Staff Secretary plays a key role in determining who weighs in on policy matters and when. ", "As noted above, the Staff Secretary also handles information leaving the Oval Office. ", "The President may have questions after reviewing incoming material, may wish to seek more information, or may demand revisions. ", "The Staff Secretary is often responsible for directing these requests to the appropriate places and following up on them to ensure that they are completed. ", "One of the Staff Secretary\u2019s critical functions is managing and overseeing the clearance process for the President\u2019s daily/nightly briefing book. ", "This book is filled with all the reading material and leading documentation the President needs in the morning and the evening to help him make decisions. ", "The Staff Secretary also oversees the use of the President\u2019s signature, whether by hand or by autopen, and manages the Office of the Executive Clerk, Office of Records Management, and Office of Presidential Correspondence. ", "OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS\n", "The Office of Communications, which operates under the Director of Communications, conveys the President\u2019s agenda to the public through various media, including speeches and remarks, press briefings, off-the-record discussions with reporters, and social media.

", "Operational functions of the Office of Communications include scheduling and running press briefings, interviews, meetings, media appearances, speeches, and a range of other events. ", "The Office of Communications must maintain robust relationships with the White House Press Corps, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, regional stakeholders, and key interest groups. ", "No legal entitlement exists for the provision of permanent space for media on the White House campus, and the next Administration should reexamine the balance between media demands and space constraints on the White House premises. ", "Leadership within the Office of Communications should include a Communications Director (who is a direct report to the Chief of Staff), a Deputy Communications Director, a Deputy Director for Strategic Communications, and a Press Secretary. ", "This leadership team must work together closely to drive the national narrative about the White House. ", "The best resource for the Office of Communications is the President. ", "The President conveys the White House\u2019s overall message through one or two inaugural addresses, State of the Union addresses, speeches to Congress, and press conferences. ", "The office must also ensure that the various White House offices disseminate a unified message to the public. ", "The Communications Director and Press Secretary in particular should be careful to avoid contradicting the President or delivering conflicting information. ", "The speechwriting team is a critical component of the communications team. ", "Speechwriting is a unique talent: ", "The writers selected must understand policy, should have a firm grasp of history and other liberal-arts disciplines, and should be able to learn and adopt the President\u2019s style of rhetoric and mode of delivery. ", "The Press Secretary is the President\u2019s spokesperson, communicating to the American people through the media. ", "The Press Secretary engages with the White House Press Corps formally through press briefings and informally through impromptu gaggles and meetings. ", "Individuals who serve in this role must be quick on their feet, which means, when appropriate, deftly refuting and rebutting correspondents\u2019 questions and comments. ", "The Communications Director must convey the President\u2019s mission to the American people. ", "Especially for conservatives, this means navigating the mainstream media to ensure that the President\u2019s agenda is conveyed effectively and accurately. ", "The Communications Director must be politically savvy and very aware of the ongoing activities of the other White House offices. ", "The new Administration should examine the nature of the relationship between itself and the White House Correspondents Association and consider whether an alternative coordinating body might be more suitable. ", "OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS (OLA)\n", "Created by President Dwight Eisenhower, the OLA has continued to serve as the liaison between the White House and Congress. ", "The White House must work with congressional leaders to ensure presidential nominees, for roles such as Cabinet secretaries and ambassadors, are confirmed by the Senate. ", "The White House also relies on Congress to enact reforms promised by the President on the campaign trail, whether those promises relate to health care, education, or national defense. ", "Because Congress holds the power of the purse, White House staffers must ensure that there is enough support on the Hill to secure the necessary funding through the appropriations process to fulfill the President\u2019s agenda. ", "The OLA reports directly to the Chief of Staff and in some Administrations has done so under the guidance of a Deputy Chief of Staff (usually the Deputy Chief for Policy). ", "Regardless of the person to whom the OLA reports, however, the office exercises a certain autonomy on behalf of the President and the Chief of Staff in directly influencing congressional leaders of both major political parties. ", "The OLA often must function as the mediator among the parties and find common ground to facilitate the successful enactment of the President\u2019s agenda. ", "As is the case with many White House offices (but especially the Office of Communications), the OLA must ensure that congressional leaders receive one unified message. ", "If other actors within the White House maintain their own relationships with congressional leaders and staffers, it may appear that the President\u2019s agenda is fractured and lacks consensus. ", "This dynamic has caused real problems for many Presidents in the past. ", "Internally, OLA staffers need to be involved in policy discussions, budget reviews, and other important meetings. ", "They must also provide advice to policy staffers regarding whether certain ideas are politically feasible. ", "Externally, OLA staffers have to communicate continuously with congressional offices of both parties in both the House and the Senate to ensure that the President has enough support to enact his legislative priorities or sustain votes. ", "The OLA requires staffers who are effective communicators and can provide a dose of reality to other White House staffers when necessary. ", "Although a policy proposal from within the White House may be a great idea, OLA staffers must ensure that it is politically feasible. ", "OLA staffers must therefore be skilled in both politics and policy. ", "Furthermore, the President should seek out individuals who can advance his agenda and at the same time forge pathways with members of the opposing political party on other priorities. ", "Most important, the OLA must function as a well-oiled machine: ", "precisely synced. ", "The President cannot afford to have a tennis player on\u2014much less as the leader of\u2014his football team. ", "OFFICE OF PRESIDENTIAL PERSONNEL (PPO)\n", "The political axiom that \u201cpersonnel is policy\u201d was popularized under President Ronald Reagan during the 1981 presidential transition. ", "One of the most important offices in the White House is the PPO, which was created under President Richard Nixon to centralize political appointments. ", "Departments and agencies had and still have direct legal authority on hiring and firing, but the power to fill Schedule C positions\u2014the core of political jobs\u2014is vested with the President. ", "Therefore, the White House, not the department or agency, has the final word on political appointments. ", "PPO\u2019s primary responsibility is to staff the executive branch with individuals who are equipped to implement the President\u2019s agenda. ", "Although its focus should be identifying and recruiting leaders to fill the approximately 1,000 appointments that require Senate confirmation, PPO must also fill approximately 3,000 political jobs that require dedicated conservatives to support the Administration\u2019s political leadership. ", "Frequently, many medium-tier and top-tier jobs have been filled by policy experts tasked with accomplishing much of the work of the Administration. ", "At the same time, appointees in the entry-level jobs have brought invaluable energy and commitment to the White House and have proved to be the \u201cfarm team\u201d for the conservative movement.

", "Serving as a personnel link between conservative organizations and the executive branch. ", "In most Administrations, PPO will staff more than 100 positions during a transition and thousands of noncareer positions during the President\u2019s first term. ", "Direct authority and a strong relationship with the President are necessary attributes for any PPO Director. ", "Historically, PPO has had direct review and control of personnel files, including security clearance dossiers. ", "At the highest level, PPO is tasked with long-term, strategic workforce development. ", "The \u201cbillets\u201d of political appointments are of immense importance in credentialing and training future leaders. ", "In addition, whatever one\u2019s view of the constitutionality of various civil service rules (for example, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 19986) might be, it is necessary to ensure that departments and agencies have robust cadres of political staff just below senior levels in the event of unexpected vacancies. ", "OFFICE OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS (OPA)\n", "The OPA is the primary office within the executive branch for managing the President\u2019s political interests. ", "Although its specific functions vary from Administration to Administration, the OPA typically serves as the liaison between the President and associated political entities: national committees, federal and state campaigns, and interest groups. ", "Within legal guidelines, the OPA engages in outreach, conducts casework, and\u2014if the President is up for reelection\u2014assists with his campaign. ", "The OPA may also monitor congressional campaigns, arrange presidential visits with other political campaigns, and recommend campaign staff to the Office of Presidential Personnel for service in the executive branch. ", "The OPA further serves as a line of communication between the White House and the President\u2019s political party. ", "This includes both relaying the President\u2019s ambitions to political interests and listening to the needs of political interests. ", "This relationship allows for the exchange of information between the White House and political actors across the country. ", "The OPA should have one director of political affairs who reports either to the Chief of Staff or to a Deputy Chief of Staff. ", "The OPA should also include various deputy directors, each of whom is responsible for a certain geographical region of the country. ", "Because nearly all White House activities are in some way inherently political, the OPA needs to be aware of all presidential actions and activities\u2014including travel, policy decisions, speeches, nominations, and responses to matters of national security\u2014and consider how they might affect the President\u2019s image. ", "The OPA must therefore have a designated staffer who communicates not only with other White House offices, but also with the Cabinet and executive branch agencies. ", "OFFICE OF CABINET AFFAIRS (OCA)\n", "The OCA\u2019s role has changed to some degree over the course of various Administrations, but its overriding function remains the same: ", "to ensure the coordination of policy and communication between the White House and the Cabinet. ", "Most important, the OCA coordinates all Cabinet meetings with the President. ", "It should also organize and administer regular meetings of the Deputy Secretaries because they also typically serve vital roles in the departments and agencies and, further, often become acting secretaries when Cabinet members resign. ", "There should be one Cabinet Secretary who reports to the Chief of Staff\u2019s office, either directly or through a deputy chief, according to the chief\u2019s preference and focus. ", "The Cabinet Secretary maintains a direct relationship with all members of the Cabinet. ", "The OCA further consists of deputies and special assistants who work with each department\u2019s principal, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and other senior staff. ", "The OCA also connects the departments to WHO offices. ", "The OCA coordinates with the Chief of Staff\u2019s office and the Office of Communications to promote the President\u2019s agenda through the Cabinet departments and agencies. ", "The Cabinet\u2019s communications staffers are obviously another critical component of this operation. ", "In prior Administrations, the OCA has played a vital role by tracking the President\u2019s agenda for the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs, and senior advisers. ", "It has worked with each department and agency to advance policy priorities. ", "In the future, amplifying this function would truly benefit both the President and the conservative movement. ", "From time to time throughout an Administration, travel optics, ethics challenges, and Hatch Act7 issues involving Cabinet members, deputies, and senior staffers can arise. ", "The OCA is normally tasked with keeping the WHO informed of such developments and providing support if and when necessary. ", "The ideal Cabinet Secretary will have exceptional organizational skills and be a seasoned political operative or attorney. ", "Because many Cabinet officials have been former presidential candidates, governors, ambassadors, and Members of Congress, the ideal candidate should also possess the ability to interact with and persuade accomplished individuals. ", "OFFICE OF PUBLIC LIAISON (OPL)\n", "The OPL is critically important in building coalitions and support for the President\u2019s agenda across every aligned social, faith-based, minority, and economic interest group. ", "It is a critical tool for shaping public opinion and keeping myriad supporters, as well as \u201cfrenemies\u201d and opponents alike who are within reach, better informed. ", "The OPL is a notably large office. ", "It should have one Director who reports to the Chief of Staff\u2019s office, either directly or through a deputy, according to the chief\u2019s preference and focus. ", "The Director must maintain relationships not only with other WHO heads, but also with the senior staff of every Cabinet department and agency. ", "Since a President\u2019s agenda is always in motion, it is important for the OPL to facilitate listening sessions to receive the views of the various leaders and members of key interest groups. ", "The OPL should also have a sufficient number of deputies and special assistants to cover the vast number of disparate interest groups that are engaged daily. ", "The OPL has, by far, held more meetings in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) and within the West Wing itself than any other office within the WHO. ", "The OPL is the chief White House enforcer and gatekeeper among these various interest groups. ", "It has operated best whenever the Chief of Staff has given it permission to use both the proverbial \u201ccarrot\u201d and the proverbial \u201cstick.\u201d ", "To make this work, communication with the chief\u2019s office is vital. ", "Additionally, the OPL has had an outsized role in presidential scheduling and both official and political travel. ", "The OPL Director should come from the President\u2019s election campaign or Capitol Hill\u2014but should not have deeply entrenched connections to a K Street entity or any other potential stakeholder. ", "Some prior relationships can create real or perceived biases toward one group or another. ", "The Director should be amiable, gregarious, highly organized, and willing to shoulder criticism and pushback from interest groups and other elements of the Administration. ", "Unlike the Director, OPL deputies and special assistants need a deep understanding of the capital, from K Street to Capitol Hill. ", "They should have extensive experience in private industry, the labor sector, the conservative movement, and among the specific interest groups with which they will be asked to engage on behalf of the White House. ", "OPL staffers work with more external and internal parties than any other WHO staffers. ", "In turn, they must be effective communicators and initiative-takers. ", "They must also be able to influence, persuade, and\u2014most important\u2014listen to various stakeholders and ensure that they feel heard. ", "All OPL staffers must understand from the outset that their jobs might be modified or even phased out entirely as the Administration\u2019s priorities change. ", "OFFICE OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS (IGA)\n", "The IGA connects the White House to state, county, local, and tribal governments. ", "In other words, it is the one-stop shop for disseminating an Administration\u2019s agenda to all non\u2013federal government entities. ", "The IGA should have a Director to whom one or two Deputy Directors report. ", "The Director must ensure that the White House remains connected to all non\u2013 federal government entities. ", "The interests and perspectives of these entities are represented in policy discussions, organized events with the West Wing, EOP senior staff, and IGA staff throughout the departments and agencies. ", "The IGA can be staffed in a variety of ways, but two arrangements are most common: ", "Each deputy and that deputy\u2019s staffers are responsible for a type of government. ", "A group of staffers is responsible for a specific geographical region of the country. ", "The IGA, as suggested above, represents the interests and perspectives of non\u2013 federal government entities, but its primary job is to make sure that these entities understand an Administration\u2019s agenda and ultimately support it. ", "The IGA must work with all other White House offices, especially the OPA and the OPL, and manage its staff throughout the departments and agencies. ", "IGA staffers must therefore have communication skills, understand political nuance, and be willing to engage in complex policy discussions. ", "They should also be not just generally responsive, but also proactive in seeking out the interests and perspectives of non\u2013federal government entities. ", "WHITE HOUSE POLICY COUNCILS\n", "As the federal government has ballooned in size over the past century, it has become increasingly difficult for the President alone to direct his agenda across the executive branch. ", "Three White House policy councils have come into existence to help the President to control the bureaucracy and ensure continued alignment between agency leadership and White House priorities. ", "Those councils\u2014as previewed above\u2014are the NSC, NEC, and DPC. ", "Each is headed by an Assistant to the President and performs three significant functions. ", "Policy Coordination. ", "The primary role of the policy councils is to\ncoordinate the development of Administration policy. ", "This frequently includes developing significant legislative priorities, coordinating policy decisions that impact multiple departments and agencies, and at times coordinating policy decisions within a single department or agency. ", "This process must ensure that all relevant offices are included; that competing or conflicting opinions are thoroughly discussed and evaluated; and, when there is disagreement among White House senior staff or among Cabinet members, a well-structured question is presented to the President for an intermediate or final decision. ", "Policy Advice. ", "By virtue of working in the White House, the heads of the\nthree policy councils will also function as independent policy advisers to the President. ", "This aspect of the role will vary depending on the individual in this position and the President\u2019s governing philosophy. ", "Incumbents have ranged from \u201chonest brokers,\u201d who mostly coordinate and ensure that all opinions are fairly presented to the President, to \u201cpolicy deciders,\u201d who largely drive a given policy topic on behalf of the President. ", "l Policy Implementation. ", "The policy councils also manage and mediate\nthe implementation of previous policy decisions. ", "Implementation of a new statute or an executive order frequently takes years and involves many distinct and more granular policy decisions along the way. ", "It is essential to have a centralized process for evaluating and coordinating these decisions, especially if they involve more than one Cabinet department or agency with differing opinions on the best approach for securing the President\u2019s goals. ", "The above functions have recently been managed by policy councils through a tiered interagency policy process. ", "This process helps to identify differences of opinion and reach a decision without having to take every issue to the President. ", "It can be used to address a single question or monitor a recurring issue on an ongoing basis. ", "Typically, the process involves multiple Cabinet departments and agencies that have a pertinent role, policy interest, or disagreement. ", "Each policy council\u2019s process could involve the following committees: ", "Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC). ", "A PCC is led by a Special\nAssistant to the President from the policy council and includes political Assistant Secretary\u2013level experts from the relevant departments, agencies, or offices. ", "The purpose is to determine where consensus exists, clearly identify where there are differing opinions, and develop options for resolving the remaining questions. ", "If no outstanding questions or disagreements exist, the PCC may resolve the issue and move toward implementation at the agency level. ", "Deputies Committee (DC). ", "A DC is a meeting of presidentially appointed\nexecutives chaired by the policy council\u2019s Deputy Assistant to the President and relevant Deputy Secretaries. ", "It evaluates the options produced by the PCC and frequently directs the PCC to add, expand, or reevaluate an option or even to reach a compromise and resolve an issue at that level. ", "Principals Committee (PC). ", "When questions are not resolved by a DC,\nthe Director of the Policy Council will chair a PC, which is attended by the relevant Cabinet Secretaries and senior White House political staff. ", "This is the final opportunity for the President\u2019s most senior advisers to discuss the question, make sure that each principal\u2019s position is carefully understood, and see whether consensus or a compromise might be reached. ", "If not, the Chief of Staff\u2019s office will schedule time for the PC to meet with the President for a final decision. ", "Despite having seemingly clear and separate portfolios, the three policy councils frequently have areas of overlap, which can result in confusion, duplication, or conflict. ", "For example, there are the areas of immigration and border security (either NSC or DPC); health care, energy, and environment (either NEC or DPC); and trade and international economic policy (either NSC or NEC). ", "Identifying these potentially problematic areas and assigning policy responsibilities to only one council where possible will help to speed up the policy-coordination process. ", "While other chapters will cover specific policy goals for each department or agency, incoming policy councils will need to move rapidly to lead policy processes around cross-cutting agency topics, including countering China, enforcing immigration laws, reversing regulatory policies in order to promote energy production, combating the Left\u2019s aggressive attacks on life and religious liberty, and confronting \u201cwokeism\u201d throughout the federal government. ", "National Security Council. ", "The NSC is intended to be an interdepartmental body within the White House that can set national security policy with a\nwhole-of-government approach.

", "The National Security Adviser and NSC staff advise the President on matters of foreign policy and national security, serve as an information conduit in times of crisis, and as liaisons ensuring that written communications are properly shared among NSC members. ", "Special attention should be given to the use of detailees to staff the NSC. ", "In recent years, the NSC\u2019s staff size has been rightsized from its peak of 400 in 2015 down to 100\u2013150 professional members.

", "The NEC considers economic policy matters, and the DPC typically considers anything related to domestic matters with the exception of economic policy matters. ", "It also differs from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). ", "Whereas the NEC is in charge of policy development, the CEA acts as the White House\u2019s internal research arm for economic analysis. ", "It is therefore critically important to find people with the right qualifications to head both the NEC and the CEA. ", "The CEA is almost always led by a well-known academic economist, and the NEC is regularly led by someone with expertise in directing the President\u2019s economic policy process. ", "Those who have served in the role have ranged from former CEOs of the nation\u2019s largest investment firms to financial-services industry managers to seasoned congressional staffers who have managed the economic policy issues for top financial and tax-writing committees.

", "In this respect, both the Director and the Deputy Director have critical institutional functions that affect the development of domestic policy throughout the Administration. ", "The DPC also has policy experts (for example, Special Assistants to the President or SAPs) who are responsible for developing and coordinating, as well as for advising the President, on specific issues. ", "It is essential that DPC policy expertise reflect the most prominent issues that are before the Administration: issues such as the environment, health care, housing, and immigration. ", "In addition, DPC SAPs should demonstrate a working knowledge of the rulemaking process (although they need not necessarily be experts on regulation) because a working knowledge of the rulemaking process will facilitate the DPC\u2019s effectiveness in coordinating Administration policy. ", "The DPC also needs to work closely with other offices within the Executive Office of the President to promote economic opportunity and private-sector innovation. ", "This includes working with the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as well as the Council of Economic Advisers, Council on Environmental Quality, and Office of Science and Technology Policy. ", "To this end, the Director should chair a standing meeting with the principals from each of the other EOP offices to enhance coordination from within the White House. ", "Several areas will be especially important as the DPC works to develop a well-defined domestic policy agenda. ", "One is the promotion of innovation as a foundation for economic growth and opportunity. ", "The President should establish an economic opportunity working group, chaired by the DPC Director, to coordinate the development of policies that promote economic opportunity. ", "Another important area is the promotion of health care reform to bring down costs for the American people and the pressure that spending on health programs puts on the federal budget. ", "Finally, DPC should coordinate with the NSC on a policy agenda to enhance border security. ", "OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT (OVP)\n", "In modern U.S. history, the Vice President has acted as a significant adviser to the President.

", "The President must set and enforce a plan for the executive branch. ", "Sadly, however, a President today assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its own policy plans and preferences\u2014or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly \u201cwoke\u201d faction of the country. ", "The modern conservative President\u2019s task is to limit, control, and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people. ", "This challenge is created and exacerbated by factors like Congress\u2019s decades-long tendency to delegate its lawmaking power to agency bureaucracies, the pervasive notion of expert \u201cindependence\u201d that protects so-called expert authorities from scrutiny, the presumed inability to hold career civil servants accountable for their performance, and the increasing reality that many agencies are not only too big and powerful, but also increasingly weaponized against the public and a President who is elected by the people and empowered by the Constitution to govern. ", "In Federalist No. 47, James Madison warned that \u201c[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d", "2 ", "Regrettably, that wise and cautionary note describes to a significant degree the modern executive branch, which\u2014whether controlled by the bureaucracy or by the President\u2014writes federal policy, enforces that policy, and often adjudicates whether that policy was properly drafted and enforced. ", "The overall situation is constitutionally dire, unsustainably expensive, and in urgent need of repair. ", "Nothing less than the survival of self-governance in America is at stake. ", "The great challenge confronting a conservative President is the existential need for aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch to return power\u2014 including power currently held by the executive branch\u2014to the American people. ", "Success in meeting that challenge will require a rare combination of boldness and self-denial: boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will and self-denial to use the bureaucratic machine to send power away from Washington and back to America\u2019s families, faith communities, local governments, and states. ", "Fortunately, a President who is willing to lead will find in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) the levers necessary to reverse this trend and impose a sound direction for the nation on the federal bureaucracy. ", "The effectiveness of those EOP levers depends on the fundamental premise that it is the President\u2019s agenda that should matter to the departments and agencies that operate under his constitutional authority and that, as a general matter, it is the President\u2019s chosen advisers who have the best sense of the President\u2019s aims and intentions, both with respect to the policies he intends to enact and with respect to the interests that must be secured to govern successfully on behalf of the American people. ", "This chapter focuses on key features of and recommendations for several of the EOP\u2019s important components. ", "U.S. OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET (OMB)\n", "OMB assists the President in the execution of his policy agenda across the government by employing many statutory and executive procedural levers to bring the bureaucracy in line with all budgetary, regulatory, and management decisions. ", "Properly understood, it is a President\u2019s air-traffic control system with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course. ", "OMB\u2019s key roles include: ", "Developing and enforcing the President\u2019s budget and executing the\nappropriations laws that fund the government; ", "Managing agency and personnel performance, procurement policy,\nfinancial management, and information technology; ", "Developing the President\u2019s regulatory agenda, reviewing new regulatory\nactions, reviewing federal information collections, and setting and enforcing federal information policy; ", "and ", "Coordinating and clearing agency communications with Congress,\nincluding testimonies and views on draft legislation. ", "OMB cannot perform its role on behalf of the President effectively if it is not intimately involved in all aspects of the White House policy process and lacks knowledge of what the agencies are doing. ", "Internally to the EOP, ensuring that the policy-formulation procedures developed by the White House to serve the President include OMB is one of any OMB Director\u2019s major responsibilities. ", "A common meme of those who intend to evade OMB review is to argue that where \u201cresources\u201d are not being discussed, OMB\u2019s participation is optional. ", "This ignores both OMB\u2019s role in all downstream execution and the reality that it has the only statutory tools in the White House that are powerful enough to override implementing agencies\u2019 bureaucracies. ", "The Director must view his job as the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President\u2019s mind as it pertains to the policy agenda while always being ready with actual options to effect that agenda within existing legal authorities and resources. ", "This role cannot be performed adequately if the Director acts instead as the ambassador of the institutional interests of OMB and the wider bureaucracy to the White House. ", "Once its reputation as the keeper of \u201ccommander\u2019s intent\u201d is established, then and only then does OMB have the ability to shape the most efficient way to pursue an objective. ", "Externally, the Director must ensure that OMB has sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making. ", "One indispensable statutory tool to that end is to ensure that policy officials\u2014the Program Associate Directors (PADs) managing the vast Resource Management Offices (RMOs)\u2014personally sign what are known as the apportionments. ", "In 1870, Congress passed the Anti-Deficiency Act3 to prevent the common agency practice of spending down all appropriated funding, creating artificial funding shortfalls that Congress would have to fill. ", "The law mandated that all funding be allotted or \u201capportioned\u201d in installments. ", "This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars. ", "OMB can then direct on behalf of a President the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the President\u2019s agenda and applicable laws. ", "The vast majority of these apportionments were signed by career officials\u2014the Deputy Associate Directors (DADs)\u2014until the Trump Administration placed this responsibility in the hands of the PADs and thereby opened wide vistas of oversight that had escaped the attention of policy officials. ", "The Biden Administration subsequently reversed this decision. ", "No Director should be chosen who is unwilling to restore apportionment decision-making to the PADs\u2019 personal review, who is not aggressive in wielding the tool on behalf of the President\u2019s agenda, or who is unable to defend the power against attacks from Congress. ", "It should be noted that each of OMB\u2019s primary functions, along with other executive and statutory roles, is carried out with the help of many essential OMB support offices. ", "The two most important offices for moving OMB at the will of a Director are the Budget Review Division (BRD) and the Office of General Counsel (OGC). ", "The Director should have a direct and effective relationship with the head of the BRD (considered the top career official within OMB) and transmit most instructions through that office because the rest of the agency is institutionally inclined toward its direction and responds accordingly. ", "The BRD inevitably will translate the directions from policy officials to the career staff, and at every stage, it is obviously vital that the Director ensure that this translation is an accurate one. ", "In addition, many key considerations involved in enacting a President\u2019s agenda hinge on existing legal authorities. ", "The Director must ensure the appointment of a General Counsel who is respected yet creative and fearless in his or her ability to challenge legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo. ", "This is vital within OMB not only with respect to the adequate development of policy options for the President\u2019s review, but also with respect to agencies that attempt to protect their own institutional interests and foreclose certain avenues based on the mere assertion (and not proof) that the law disallows it or that, conversely, attempt to disregard the clear statutory commands of Congress. ", "In general, the Director should empower a strong Deputy Director with authority over the Deputy for Management, the PADs, and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to work diligently to break down barriers within OMB and not allow turf disputes or a lack of visibility to undermine the agency\u2019s principal budget, management, and regulatory functions. ", "OMB should work toward a \u201cOne OMB\u201d position on behalf of the President and represent that view during the various policymaking processes. ", "Budget. ", "The United States today faces an untenable fiscal situation and owes\n$31 trillion on a debt that is steadily increasing. ", "The OMB Director should present a fiscal goal to the President early in the budget development process to address the federal government\u2019s fiscal irresponsibility. ", "This goal would help to align the months-long process of developing the actual proposals for inclusion in the budget. ", "Though some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the President\u2019s budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public policy at federal agencies. ", "The budget team includes six Resource Management Offices that, together with the BRD and other components, help the Director of OMB to develop and execute detailed agency spending plans that bear on every major aspect of policy formation and execution at federal agencies. ", "Through initial priority-setting and ongoing supervision of agency spending, OMB\u2019s budget team plays a key role in executing policy across the executive branch, including at many agencies wrongly regarded as \u201cindependent.\u201d ", "The RMOs, each of which is led by a political appointee known as the PAD and a career DAD, are separated into six functional units: ", "National Security. ", "Natural Resources, Energy, and Science. ", "Health. ", "Education, Income Maintenance, and Labor. ", "Transportation, Justice, and Homeland Security. ", "Treasury, Commerce, and Housing. ", "Because the RMOs are institutionally ingrained in nearly all policymaking and implementation across the executive branch, they play a critical role in helping the Director to implement the President\u2019s public policy agenda. ", "However, because each RMO is responsible for formulating and supervising such a wide range of policy details, many granular but critical policy decisions are effectively left to the career professionals who serve across Administrations. ", "To enhance the OMB Director\u2019s ability to help the President drive policy at the agencies, the existing six RMOs should be divided into smaller subject-matter areas, allowing for more PADs, and each of these PADs should have a Deputy PAD. ", "This expanded pool of RMOs with additional political leadership would enable more comprehensive direction and oversight of policy development and implementation. ", "Regardless of whether Congress adopts the President\u2019s full set of budget recommendations, the President should reintroduce the concept of administrative pay-as-you-go, or administrative PAYGO. ", "This simple procedural requirement imposes budget neutrality on the discretionary choices of federal agencies, of which there are many in nearly all areas of policymaking. ", "This simple step forces the executive branch to control what it can control. ", "The principle may occasionally yield to other overarching requirements, such as a presidential regulatory budget, but in nearly all cases, administrative PAYGO plays a unique and indispensable role in enforcing fiscal responsibility at federal departments and agencies.

", "In the end, change requires intervention, and the NSC staff should be appropriately recruited, manned, and empowered to achieve the President\u2019s national security and foreign policy objectives and maintain robust policy analysis and discussion while minimizing resistance from those who have an agenda or who jealously guard their resources and autonomy at the expense of national security and sound policy development. ", "This resistance and inertia can be inadvertently enabled by a small and unempowered NSC. ", "Additionally, the White House Chief of Staff and NSA must ensure that the NSC is functioning in tandem with the rest of the White House staff to benefit from the best strategic thinking of the President\u2019s top advisers. ", "History shows that an unsupervised NSC staff can stray from its statutory role and adversely affect a President and his policies. ", "Moreover, while the NSC should be fully incorporated into the White House, it should also be allowed to do its job without the impediment of dually hatted staff that report to other offices.

", "The President should ensure that the USTR is empowered to serve in that leadership role, much as other EOP components organize and drive a coordinated policy agenda on behalf of the President. ", "The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s predatory trade practices have disrupted the open-market trading system that has provided mutual benefit to all participating countries\u2014including China\u2014for decades. ", "The failure of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to discipline China for abrogation of its trading commitments has seriously undermined its credibility and made it a largely ineffective institution. ", "The United States, through an empowered USTR, must act to rebalance and refocus international trading relationships in favor of democratic nations that embrace free, fair, and open trade principles built on market-driven economies. ", "Chapter 26 of this book outlines recommended trade policy priorities for the incoming President. ", "However, regardless of the approach, successful implementation of that trade agenda will require the President to articulate a clear policy direction and instructions for the executive branch to operate in a coordinated fashion under the leadership of an empowered USTR. ", "To address these and other challenges, protect the American worker, and secure free and open markets for our communities and businesses, the next President must leverage the institutional resources and strength of the USTR and neither allow institutional interests to drive a fragmented trade policy that is developed from the ground up nor cater to parochial interests across government and Wash ington\u2019s broader industry of influence. ", "The USTR\u2019s mission is vitally important in reorienting the global trading system in a direction that is open, fair, and prosperous. ", "In order to achieve the President\u2019s policy goals, a strong USTR must be empowered to set trade policy from the White House with the authority and resources to represent the interests of the President\u2019s trade agenda with adequate budget, staff, analysis, and expertise to engage meaningfully in internal and interagency policy deliberations. ", "The USTR should organize and harness existing interagency trade committees to serve the President\u2019s trade agenda and drive a consensus among federal stakeholders, dispose of legacy advisory committees with members who serve special interests, direct action to implement policy priorities, measure progress toward implementing the President\u2019s agenda, and hold agencies and officials accountable for delivering the President\u2019s agenda. ", "The USTR\u2019s leadership should not only coordinate and enforce the President\u2019s agenda across the federal community, but also set and enforce the President\u2019s trade agenda internally. ", "Trade policy and priorities should be set by the President and implemented by the U.S. Trade Representative in cooperation with the other economic and national security officials, not by the range of governmental and nongovernmental interests that attempt to force their policy preferences on the USTR. ", "A strong USTR empowered with the necessary resources, authorities, and interagency cooperation will protect U.S. interests in the global marketplace more effectively. ", "COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS (CEA)\n", "Congress established the Council of Economic Advisers in 1946 to advise the President on economic policy based on data, research, and evidence. ", "The CEA is one of the oldest congressionally created offices within the White House complex and plays a broad role in bringing economic expertise to Administration policy across a large range of policy areas. ", "The CEA has one presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed chair, two presidentially appointed members who assist and often have expertise that complements the chair, and approximately 40 staff employees. ", "Statutorily, the CEA is charged with being the President\u2019s principal source of economic advice. ", "However, this role has diminished over time as its policy appraisal and especially formulation and recommendation functions have been taken over or diluted by other economic policy bodies within the White House. ", "By law, the CEA is required to publish an annual Economic Report of the President within 10 days after submission of the budget. ", "This report is not just a messaging document; it is an opportunity to provide greater rigor in support of policy areas that the White House is prioritizing and to build up the external credibility of those ideas. ", "A future conservative Administration should utilize the CEA as the senior internal White House economists much as the White House Counsel\u2019s office functions as the senior internal White House lawyers. ", "This does not mean that there are no economists in other offices. ", "There are, just as there often are lawyers in the policy councils and other White House offices, but the CEA\u2019s role, like the White House Counsel\u2019s, is to employ its unique expertise (particularly on the technical side) to ensure that sound analysis is contributing to and shaping the policy discussion. ", "In practice, this means that CEA staff do not \u201ccoordinate\u201d the policy process in the way that the DPC or NEC would, but they should be integral to the EOP\u2019s policy development processes. ", "CEA staff should support sound policy development and execution by actively contributing to running policy dialogues, proactively raising issues that need to be addressed, consulting on questions that arise, and guiding EOP and agency officials on the analytical foundations of policy. ", "Structurally, the White House Chief of Staff should ensure that the CEA has a seat at the policymaking table on all relevant policy. ", "Senior economists traditionally have not gone through the Office of Presidential Personnel process and more often than not are hired on an academic-year cycle. ", "As a result, senior economists hired in the summer of a presidential election year tend to remain on staff until the next summer even if a President from the opposite party takes power and installs a new slate of CEA political appointees for chair, members, etc. ", "Although these hiring practices create some continuity, the presence of senior economists who were never fully vetted for their alignment with White House policy objectives or who were holdovers from a recently departed Administration can breed skepticism and distrust of the CEA by other units within the White House, creating the risk that the CEA\u2019s role in the policymaking process will be diminished. ", "A future Administration should consider hiring that reflects the White House calendar (mid-January) and involves the Office of Presidential Personnel. ", "NATIONAL SPACE COUNCIL (NSPC)\n", "The National Space Council is responsible for providing advice and recommendations to the President on the formulation and implementation of space policy and strategy. ", "It is charged with conducting a whole-of-government approach to the nation\u2019s space interests: civil, military, intelligence, commercial, or diplomatic. ", "Historically, it has been chaired by the Vice President at the President\u2019s direction, and its members consist of members of the Cabinet and other senior executive branch officials as specified by the President in Executive Order 13803.32 ", "The NSpC\u2019s purpose is to ensure that the President\u2019s priorities relative to space are carried out and, as necessary, to resolve policy conflicts among departments and agencies that are related to space. ", "Space projects and programs are risky, complex, expensive, and time consuming\u2014although commercial space innovations are lowering costs and accelerating schedules. ", "Nevertheless, while fiscal discipline should not be ignored, long-term policy stability is crucial to investors, innovators, industry, and agencies. ", "Policy stability is easier when policies and programs are aligned with long-term national interests as opposed to those of particular advocacy groups or political factions. ", "The Trump Administration\u2019s major space policies\u2014including the U.S. Space Force, the Artemis program to land the next Americans on the moon, and support for a strong commercial space sector\u2014have endured under the Biden Administration. ", "Major challenges remain in implementation and regulatory reform to keep up with rapidly evolving space markets and competitors. ", "These include the long-term sustainability of space activities in light of increasing orbital debris; creation of space situational awareness services for civil and commercial uses; management of mega-constellations; licensing of new commercial remote sensing capabilities; keeping up with licensing demands due to high launch rates; transitioning International Space Station operations to multiple, privately owned space platforms; and (most important) accelerating the acquisition and fielding of national security space capabilities in response to an increasingly aggressive China. ", "The Vice President should have a clear understanding with the National Security Advisor and the White House Counsel that they and their respective staffs will work within the White House to determine the scope and leadership of policy reviews that can overlap multiple areas of responsibility. ", "A similar understanding is necessary with the heads of other policy councils such as the NEC, DPC, and National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). ", "As a result of the President\u2019s direction and the Vice President\u2019s leadership, the NSpC under the Trump Administration was able to coordinate a wide range of space policy reviews, legislative proposals, and regulatory reforms smoothly. ", "The NSpC generally led on space issues within the EOP, but other White House offices also took on space topics. ", "As a member of the NSpC, and in coordination with other members, the Office of Science and Technology Policy developed a national space weather strategy, research and development (R&D) plans to mitigate the effects of orbital debris, and protocols for planetary protection to avoid biological contamination of celestial bodies. ", "The Council of Economic Advisers did research on the economic benefits of space property rights. ", "OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Reform updated and streamlined commercial launch licensing and commercial remote sensing satellite rules. ", "During the Trump Administration, if a topic was purely military, such as standing up the U.S. Space Command, the NSC took the lead. ", "If a topic cut across military, civil, and commercial sectors, as was the case with cybersecurity in space, the NSpC and NSC would cochair the policy review groups. ", "Trusted, collegial relationships across the White House complex are critical to successful space policy development, implementation, and oversight. ", "Nowhere is this more important than in the relationship between the NSpC staff and OMB staff who oversee civil and national security\u2013related space spending. ", "Teamwork between the NSpC and OMB staff can communicate clear presidential priorities to departments and agencies, facilitating smooth development of the President\u2019s budget request. ", "The NSpC and OMB have many opportunities to collaborate in promoting presidential priorities while finding offsets in lower-priority programs and funding lines. ", "OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY (OSTP)\n", "The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was created by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976.", "33 ", "Before its creation, Presidents received their advice and counsel on such matters through advisers and boards that had no statutory authority. ", "The Director of OSTP is one of the few Senate-confirmed positions within the Executive Office of the President. ", "Consistent with other laws, the President may delegate to the Director of OSTP directive authority over other elements of the executive branch. ", "Other EOP policy officials and organizations such as the NSC and NEC are formally only advisory with relevant agency directives issued by the President. ", "The OSTP\u2019s functions, as contained in the law, are to advise the President of scientific and technological considerations, evaluate the effectiveness of the federal effort, and generally lead and coordinate the federal government\u2019s R&D programs. ", "If science is being manipulated at the agencies to support separate political and institutional agendas, the President should increase the prominence of the OSTP\u2019s Director either formally or informally. ", "This would elevate the role of science in policy discussions and subsequent outcomes and theoretically help to balance out agencies like the Departments of Energy, State, and Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency and Council on Environmental Quality. ", "The OSTP can also help to bring technical expertise to regulatory matters in support of OMB. ", "The OSTP should continue to play a lead role in coordinating federal R&D programs. ", "Recent legislation, especially the CHIPS and Science Act,34 has expanded federal policy and funding across the enterprise, and there is a need for more significant leadership in this area both to ensure effectiveness and to avoid duplication of effort. ", "As befitting its location in the White House, the OSTP must be concerned with advancing national interests and not merely the parochial concerns of departments, agencies, or parts of the scientific community. ", "During the Trump and Biden Administrations, there has been a bipartisan focus on prioritizing R&D funding around the so-called Industries of the Future (IOTF). ", "Under President Trump, IOTF priorities were artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information science (QIS), advanced communications/5G, advanced manufacturing, and biotechnology. ", "Under President Biden, this list has been expanded to include advanced materials, robotics, battery technology, cybersecurity, green products and clean technology, plant genetics and agricultural technologies, nanotechnology, and semiconductor and microelectronics technologies. ", "These priorities should be evaluated and narrowed to ensure consistency with the next Administration\u2019s priorities. ", "Given a long list of priorities, coordinating efforts across agencies and measuring success are extremely challenging. ", "The OSTP and OMB are required to work together on an annual basis to prioritize the funding requests and whatever Congress adds on top of them, but there continues to be concern about mission creep and funds expended on nonscientific R&D. ", "The President should also issue an executive order to reshape the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and related climate change research programs. ", "The USGCRP produces strategic plans and research (for example, the National Climate Assessment) that reduce the scope of legally proper options in presidential decision-making and in agency rulemakings and adjudications. ", "Also, since much environmental policymaking must run the gauntlet of judicial review, USGCRP actions can frustrate successful litigation defense in ways that the career bureaucracy should not be permitted to control. ", "The process for producing assessments should include diverse viewpoints. ", "The OSTP and OMB should jointly assess the independence of the contractors used to conduct much of this outsourced government research that serves as the basis for policymaking. ", "The next President should critically analyze and, if required, refuse to accept any USGCRP assessment prepared under the Biden Administration. ", "The President should also restore related EOP research components to their purely informational and advisory roles. ", "Consistent with the Global Change Research Act of 1990,35 USGCRP-related EOP components should be confined to a more limited advisory role. ", "These components should include but not necessarily be limited to the OSTP; the NSTC\u2019s Committee on Environment; the USGCRP\u2019s Interagency Groups (for example, the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group); and the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. ", "As a general matter, the new Administration should separate the scientific risk assessment function from the risk management function, which is the exclusive domain of elected policymakers and the public. ", "Finally, the next Administration will face a significant challenge in unwinding policies and procedures that are used to advance radical gender, racial, and equity initiatives under the banner of science. ", "Similarly, the Biden Administration\u2019s climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding. ", "As with other federal departments and agencies, the Biden Administration\u2019s leveraging of the federal government\u2019s resources to further the woke agenda should be reversed and scrubbed from all policy manuals, guidance documents, and agendas, and scientific excellence and innovation should be restored as the OSTP\u2019s top priority. ", "COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (CEQ)\n", "The Council on Environmental Quality is the EOP component with the principal task of administering the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)36 by issuing regulations and interpretive documents and by overseeing the processes of individual permitting agencies\u2019 own NEPA regulations, including categorical exclusions. ", "The CEQ also coordinates environmental policy across the federal government, and its influence has waxed and waned across Administrations. ", "The President should instruct the CEQ to rewrite its regulations implementing NEPA along the lines of the historic 2020 effort and restoring its key provisions such as banning the use of cumulative impact analysis. ", "This effort should incorporate new learning and more aggressive reform options that were not included in the 2020 reform package with the overall goal of streamlining the process to build on the Supreme Court ruling that \u201cCEQ\u2019s interpretation of NEPA is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d", "37 ", "It should frame the new regulations to limit the scope for judicial review of agency NEPA analysis and judicial remedies, as well as to vindicate the strong public interest in effective and timely agency action. ", "The Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC), of which the CEQ is a part, has been empowered by Congress through significant new funding and amendments to FAST-41.", "38 ", "The President should build on this foundation to further empower the FPISC by making its Executive Director an EOP appointee with delegated presidential directive authority over executive branch permitting agencies. ", "For instance, the implementation of Executive Order 13807\u2019s One Federal Decision39 revealed many ways that the systems established by EO 13807 can be improved. ", "The new President should seek to issue a new executive order to create a unified process for major infrastructure projects that includes giving project proponents more control of any regulatory clocks. ", "The President should issue an executive order establishing a Senior Advisor to coordinate the policy development and implementation of relevant energy and environment policy by officials across the EOP (for example, the policy staff of the NSC, NEC, DPC, CEQ, and OSTP) and abolishing the existing Office of Domestic Climate Policy. ", "The Senior Advisor would report directly to the Chief of Staff. ", "The role would be similar to the role that Brian Deese and John Podesta had in the Obama White House. ", "This energy/environment coordinator would help to lead the fight for sound energy and environment policies both domestically and internationally. ", "The President should eliminate the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which is cochaired by the OSTP, OMB, and CEA, and by executive order should end the use of SCC analysis. ", "Finally, the President should work with Congress to establish a sweeping modernization of the entire permitting system across all departments and agencies that is aimed at reducing litigation risk and giving agencies the authority to establish programmatic, general, and provisional permits. ", "OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY (ONDCP)\n", "Congress created the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 198840 to serve as a coordinative auxiliary for the President on all matters related to drug policy. ", "The next President\u2019s top drug policy priority must be to address the current fentanyl crisis and reduce the number of overdoses and fatalities. ", "This crisis resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 Americans in 2021. ", "The next Administration must reaffirm a commitment to preventing drug use before it starts, providing treatment that leads to long-term recovery, and reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United States. ", "The drug trafficking environment is exponentially more dynamic and dangerous today than it was just five years ago as powerful synthetic opioids (fentanyl and its analogues) are mixed into other drugs of abuse. ", "Drug trafficking organizations are extremely nimble and able to adapt quickly to federal government actions and changes in user behavior. ", "Disrupting the flow of drugs across our borders and into our communities is of paramount importance, both to save lives and to bolster our public health efforts. ", "For these reasons, the Director of ONDCP should make it a point to consult with federal border enforcement officials. ", "The National Drug Control Program agencies represented a total of $41 billion in fiscal year 2022. ", "Whereas the position for overseeing budget activities is traditionally held by a career official, it is imperative that a political appointee lead the ONDCP budget office to ensure coordination between the OMB Program Associate Director and the ONDCP budgetary appointee. ", "ONDCP grant-making activities have been controversial over the years, particularly within conservative Administrations concerned that the White House lacks the expertise to oversee such programs directly. ", "The ONDCP administers two grant programs: the Drug-Free Communities Support Program and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program. ", "While it makes sense to transfer these programs eventually to the Department of Justice and Department of Health and Human Services, respectively, it is vital that the ONDCP Director ensure in the immediate term that these grant programs are funding the President\u2019s drug control priorities and not woke nonprofits with leftist policy agendas. ", "Thus, the President must insure that the ONDCP is managed by political appointees who are committed to the Administration\u2019s agenda and not acquiesce to management by political or career military personnel who oversaw the prior Administration\u2019s ONDCP. ", "GENDER POLICY COUNCIL (GPC)\n", "The President should immediately revoke Executive Order 1402041 and every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues. ", "Abolishing the Gender Policy Council would eliminate central promotion of abortion (\u201chealth services\u201d); comprehensive sexuality education (\u201ceducation\u201d); and the new woke gender ideology, which has as a principal tenet \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. ", "In addition to eliminating the council, developing new structures and positions will have the dual effect of demonstrating that promoting life and strengthening the family is a priority while also facilitating more seamless coordination and consistency across the U.S. government. ", "Specifically, the President should appoint a position/point of contact with the rank of Special Assistant to the President or higher to coordinate and lead the President\u2019s domestic priorities on issues related to life and family in cooperation with the Domestic Policy Council. ", "This position would be responsible for facilitating meetings, discussions, and agreements among personnel; coordinating Administration policy; and ensuring agency support for implementation of policies related to the promotion of life and family in the United States.

", "The Vice President is also the President of the Senate and is charged with breaking tie votes in that body. ", "In recent years, the Vice President has been granted office space in the West Wing and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. ", "The OVP is another one of the levers that the President should use to execute his agenda. ", "This is particularly true because there is significant and unique leverage that the Vice President\u2019s leadership of the OVP can evoke to shape policy discussions and outcomes. ", "Every other appointed White House official serves at the pleasure of the President, whereas the Vice President is elected, and the process for filling vacancies in that Article II constitutional office, which includes confirmation of a replacement Vice President by a majority of both Houses of Congress, is governed by the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.", "42 ", "The Vice President has his or her own economic advisers, domestic policy and national security staff, and daily intelligence briefings. ", "The Vice President should fill his or her office with strong and sound policy minds to effectively assist the President in fulfilling his agenda.

", "All of the component councils and offices discussed in this chapter include real policy development and implementation authority, and a robust OVP should be fully integrated into all policy-formation procedures. ", "Only a Vice President who is deeply steeped in the interworking of the interagency and policy councils can offer useful advice and prove helpful in accomplishing the President\u2019s agenda. ", "It is also obvious, in view of the fact that many former Vice Presidents have gone on to be elected President in their own right,45 that the Vice Presidency can act as a training ground for presidential office. ", "In the past, the Vice President has been tasked with leading certain initiatives or issues. ", "For example, Mike Pence was tasked with coordinating the federal response to COVID-19, and both Pence and Kamala Harris have chaired the National Space Council. ", "Vice Presidents Richard Cheney and Dan Quayle were also active on the deregulatory front and in imposing regulatory moratoria. ", "However, OVP officials should be fully integrated into each and every process from the start of a new Administration and not have to wait to be invited to join various meetings or working groups on an ad hoc basis. ", "For example, the budget and regulatory review processes are linchpins in the execution of policy, and the OVP should have a seat at the table through every phase of policy development. ", "Past Vice Presidents have also spent significant time abroad serving as a type of brand ambassador for the White House and, more broadly, for the United States, announcing Administration priorities and coordinating with heads of state and other top officials of foreign governments. ", "The Vice President, as President of the Senate, often serves as a presidential emissary to the Senate and thus can be especially helpful in securing passage of the President\u2019s legislative agenda. ", "To the extent that he or she desires, a Vice President can have a direct role in shaping Administration policy.

", "At the very pinnacle of the\nmodern progressive program to make government competent stands the ideal of professionalized, career civil service. ", "Since the turn of the 20th century, progressives have sought a system that could effectively select, train, reward, and guard from partisan influence the neutral scientific experts they believe are required to staff the national government and run the administrative state. ", "Their U.S. system was initiated by the Pendleton Act of 188310 and institutionalized by the 1930s New Deal to set principles and practices that were meant to ensure that expert merit rather than partisan favors or personal favoritism ruled within the federal bureaucracy. ", "Yet, as public frustration with the civil service has grown, generating calls to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d it has become clear that their project has had serious unintended consequences. ", "The civil service was devised to replace the amateurism and presumed corruption of the old spoils system, wherein government jobs rewarded loyal partisans who might or might not have professional backgrounds. ", "Although the system appeared to be sufficient for the nation\u2019s first century, progressive intellectuals and activists demanded a more professionalized, scientific, and politically neutral Administration. ", "Progressives designed a merit system to promote expertise and shield bureaucrats from partisan political pressure, but it soon began to insulate civil servants from accountability. ", "The modern merit system increasingly made it almost impossible to fire all but the most incompetent civil servants. ", "Complying with arcane rules regarding recruiting, rating, hiring, and firing simply replaced the goal of cultivating competence and expertise. ", "In the 1970s, Georgia Democratic Governor Jimmy Carter, then a political unknown, ran for President supporting New Deal programs and their Great Society expansion but opposing the way they were being administered. ", "The policies were not actually reducing poverty, increasing prosperity, or improving the environment, he argued, and to make them work required fundamental bureaucratic reform. ", "He correctly charged that almost all government employees were rated as \u201csuccessful,\u201d all received the same pay regardless of performance, and even the worst were impossible to fire\u2014and he won the presidency. ", "President Carter fulfilled his campaign promise by hiring Syracuse University Dean Alan Campbell, who served first as Chairman of the U.S. Civil Service Commission and then as Director of the OPM and helped him devise and pass the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)11 to reset the basic structure of today\u2019s bureaucracy. ", "A new performance appraisal system was devised with a five rather than three distribution of rating categories and individual goals more related to agency missions and more related to employee promotion for all. ", "Pay and benefits were based directly on improved performance appraisals (including sizable bonuses) for mid-level managers and senior executives. ", "But time ran out on President Carter before the act could be fully executed, so it was left to President Ronald Reagan and his new OPM and agency leadership to implement. ", "Overall, the new law seemed to work for a few years under Reagan, but the Carter\u2013 Reagan reforms were dissipated within a decade. ", "Today, employee evaluation is back to pre-reform levels with almost all rated successful or above, frustrating any relation between pay and performance. ", "An \u201coutstanding\u201d rating should be required for Senior Executive Service (SES) chiefs to win big bonuses, but a few years ago, when it was disclosed that the Veterans Administration executives who encouraged false reporting of waiting lists for hospital admission were rated outstanding, the Senior Executive Association justified it, telling Congress that only outstanding performers would be promoted to the SES in the first place and that precise ratings were unnecessary.", "12 ", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO), however, has reported that pay raises, within-grade pay increases, and locality pay for regular employees and executives have become automatic rather than based on performance\u2014as a result of most employees being rated at similar appraisal levels.", "13 ", "OPM: ", "Merit Hiring in a Merit System. ", "It should not be impossible even\nfor a large national government to hire good people through merit selection. The government did so for years, but it has proven difficult in recent times to select personnel based on their knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) as the law dictates. ", "Yet for the past 34 years, the U.S. civil service has been unable to distinguish consistently between strong and unqualified applicants for employment.

", "Bonuses for SES career employees survived, but performance appraisals became so high and widely distributed that there was little relationship between performance and remuneration. ", "Ever since the original merit pay system for federal managers (GM-13 through GM-15 grade levels, just below the SES) was allowed to expire in September 1993, little to nothing has been done either to reinstate the federal merit pay program for managers or to distribute performance rating evaluations for the SES, much less to extend the program to the remainder of the workforce.

", "This gives employees multiple opportunities to prove their cases, and while the EEOC, MSPB, FLRA, and OSC may all apply essentially the same burden of proof, the odds of success may be substantially different in each forum. ", "In fact, forum shopping among them for a friendlier venue is a common practice, but frequent filers face no consequences for frivolous complaints. ", "As a result, meritorious cases are frequently delayed, denying relief and justice to truly aggrieved individuals. ", "The MSPB can and does handle all such matters, but it faces a backlog of an estimated 3,000 cases of people who were potentially wrongfully terminated or disciplined as far back as 2013. ", "From 2017\u20132022 the MSPB lacked the quorum required to decide appeals. ", "On the other hand, as of January 2023, the EEOC had a backlog of 42,000 cases. ", "While federal employees win appeals relatively infrequently\u2014MSPB administrative judges have upheld agency decisions as much as 80 percent of the time\u2014the real problem is the time and paperwork involved in the elaborate process that managers must undergo during appeals. ", "This keeps even the best managers from bringing cases in all but the most egregious cases of poor performance or misconduct. ", "As a result, the MSPB, EEOC, FLRA, and OSC likely see very few cases compared to the number of occurrences, and nonperformers continue to be paid and often are placed in nonwork positions. ", "Having a choice of appeals is especially unique to the government. ", "If lower-priority issues were addressed in-house, serious adverse actions would be less subject to delay. ", "With the proper limitation of labor union actions, the FLRA should have limited reason for appeals. ", "The EEOC\u2019s federal employee section should be transferred to the MSPB, and many of the OCS\u2019s investigatory functions should be returned to the OPM.

", "The new SES would allow management to be more flexible in filling and reassigning executive positions and locations beyond narrow specialties for more efficient mission accomplishment and would provide pay and large bonuses to motivate career performance. ", "The desire to infiltrate political appointees improperly into the high career civil service has been widespread in every Administration, whether Democrat or Republican. ", "Democratic Administrations, however, are typically more successful because they require the cooperation of careerists, who generally lean heavily to the Left. ", "Such burrowing-in requires career job descriptions for new positions that closely mirror the functions of a political appointee; a special hiring authority that allows the bypassing of veterans\u2019 preference as well as other preference categories; and the ability to frustrate career candidates from taking the desired position. ", "President Reagan\u2019s OPM began by limiting such SES burrowing-in, arguing that the proper course was to create and fill political positions.

", "It ordered the Director of OPM and agency heads to set procedures to prepare lists of such confidential, policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating positions and prepare procedures to create exceptions from civil service rules when careerists hold such positions, from which they can relocate back to the regular civil service after such service.

", "Under the early PPO, the Trump Administration appointed fewer political appointees in its first few months in office than had been appointed in any recent presidency, partly because of historically high partisan congressional obstructions but also because several officials announced that they preferred fewer political appointees in the agencies as a way to cut federal spending. ", "Whatever the reasoning, this had the effect of permanently hampering the rollout of the new President\u2019s agenda. ", "Thus, in those critical early years, much of the government relied on senior careerists and holdover Obama appointees to carry out the sensitive responsibilities that would otherwise belong to the new President\u2019s appointees.

", "After 20 years, it has not gelled into \u201cOne DHS.\u201d ", "Instead, its various components\u2019 different missions have outweighed its decades-long attempt to function as one department, rendering the whole disjointed rather than cohesive. ", "Breaking up the department along its mission lines would facilitate mission focus and provide opportunities to reduce overhead and achieve more limited government. ", "In lieu of a status quo DHS, we recommend that: ", "l U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) be combined with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); ", "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS); ", "the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR); and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) into a standalone border and immigration agency at the Cabinet level (more than 100,000 employees, making it the third largest department measured by manpower). ", "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) be moved to the Department of Transportation.

", "The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) be divided in two, with the protective element moved to DOJ and the financial enforcement element moved to the Department of the Treasury. ", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) be privatized. ", "The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) be moved to DOD and the Office of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction be moved to the FBI. ", "All of the remaining supporting components could be dismantled because their functions already exist in the moving components as well as the receiving departments. ", "Cutting these costs would save the American taxpayers significant sums. ", "Unless and until this dismantling recommendation is pursued and achieved, however, DHS will statutorily continue to exist, and it needs many reforms. ", "Accordingly, we now turn to recommended changes in DHS as it exists now. ", "MISSION STATEMENT\n", "The Department of Homeland Security protects the American homeland from and prepares for terrorism and other hazards in both the physical and cyber realms, provides for secure and free movement of trade and travel, and enforces U.S. immigration laws impartially. ", "OVERVIEW\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequent mailings of anthrax spores. ", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002,1 which created the department, states that DHS\u2019s primary mission is to prevent terrorist attacks within the U.S.; reduce the nation\u2019s vulnerability to terrorism; minimize the damage from and assist in the recovery from any terrorist attacks; prepare and respond to natural and manmade crises and emergencies; and monitor connections between illegal drug trafficking and terrorism, coordinate efforts to sever such connections, and interdict illegal drug trafficking. ", "Unfortunately for our nation, the federal government\u2019s newest department became like every other federal agency: bloated, bureaucratic, and expensive. ", "It also lost sight of its mission priorities. ", "DHS has also suffered from the Left\u2019s wokeness and weaponization against Americans whom the Left perceives as its political opponents. ", "To truly secure the homeland, a conservative Administration needs to return the department to the right mission, the right size, and the right budget. ", "This would include reorganizing the department and shifting significant resources away from several supporting components to the essential operational components. ", "Prioritizing border security and immigration enforcement, including detention and deportation, is critical if we are to regain control of the border, repair the historic damage done by the Biden Administration, return to a lawful and orderly immigration system, and protect the homeland from terrorism and public safety threats. ", "This also includes consolidating the pieces of the fragmented immigration system into one agency to fulfill the mission more efficiently. ", "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a DHS component that the Left has weaponized to censor speech and affect elections at the expense of securing the cyber domain and critical infrastructure, which are threatened daily.", "2 ", "A conservative Administration should return CISA to its statutory and important but narrow mission. ", "The bloated DHS bureaucracy and budget, along with the wrong priorities, provide real opportunities for a conservative Administration to cut billions in spending and limit government\u2019s role in Americans\u2019 lives. ", "These opportunities include privatizing TSA screening and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program, reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government, eliminating most of DHS\u2019s grant programs, and removing all unions in the department for national security purposes. ", "A successful DHS would: ", "Secure and control the border; ", "Thoroughly enforce immigration laws; ", "Correctly and efficiently adjudicate immigration benefit applications while rejecting fraudulent claims; ", "Secure the cyber domain and collaborate with critical infrastructure sectors to maintain their security; ", "Provide states and localities with a limited federal emergency response and preparedness; ", "Secure our coasts and economic zones; ", "Protect political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of state or government; ", "and Oversee transportation security. ", "OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY (SEC)\n", "In the next Administration, the Office of the Secretary should take on the following key issues and challenges to ensure the effective operation of DHS. ", "Expansion of Dedicated Political Personnel. ", "The Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity is a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed political appointee, but for budgetary reasons, he or she has historically been unable to fund a dedicated team of political appointees. ", "A key first step for the Secretary to improve front-office functions is to have his or her own dedicated team of political appointees selected and vetted by the Office of Presidential Personnel, which is not reliant on detailees from other parts of the department, to help ensure the completion of the next President\u2019s agenda. ", "An Aggressive Approach to Senate-Confirmed Leadership Positions.\n", "While Senate confirmation is a constitutionally necessary requirement for appointing agency leadership, the next Administration may need to take a novel approach to the confirmations process to ensure an adequate and rapid transition. ", "For example, the next Administration arguably should place its nominees for key positions into similar positions as \u201cactings\u201d (for example, putting in a person to serve as the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner of CBP while that person is going through the confirmation process to direct ICE or become the Secretary). ", "This approach would both guarantee implementation of the Day One agenda and equip the department for potential emergency situations while still honoring the confirmation requirement. ", "The department should also look to remove lower-level but nevertheless important positions that currently require Senate confirmation from the confirmation requirement, although this effort would require legislation (and might also be mooted in the event of legislation that closes portions of the department that currently have Senate-confirmed leadership). ", "Clearer, More Durable, and Political-Only Line of Succession. ", "Based on\nprevious experience, the department needs legislation to establish a more durable but politically oriented line of succession for agency decision-making purposes. ", "The ideal sequence for line of succession is certainly debatable, except that in circumstances where a career employee holds a leadership position in the department, that position should be deemed vacant for line-of-succession purposes and the next eligible political appointee in the sequence should assume acting authority. ", "Further, individuals wielding acting Secretary authority should have explicit authority to finalize agency actions, including regulations, to ensure that the department\u2019s homeland security mission is fulfilled. ", "Soft Closure of Unnecessary Offices. ", "Pending a possible presidential decision to shrink or eliminate DHS itself, the next Administration will still have the\nobligation to protect the homeland as required by law. ", "The Secretary therefore can and should use his or her inherent, discretionary leadership authority to \u201csoft close\u201d ineffective and problematic corners of the department. ", "While those corners are to be determined, the Secretary could shift personnel, funding, and operational responsibility to mission-essential components of the department, including the Office of the Secretary itself. ", "This effort not only would make the department more efficient, but also would support a legislative move to shrink or dismantle the department by showing that the agency can fulfill national security\u2013critical functions without its current bloated bureaucracy. ", "Restructuring and Redistribution of Career Personnel. ", "To strengthen\npolitical decision-making and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used legally and efficiently, the Secretary should make major changes in the distribution of career personnel throughout the department. ", "For example, personnel from parts of the department undergoing soft closure could be redistributed to what will be workload-intensive corners of the department, including national security\u2013critical and transparency functions. ", "All personnel with law enforcement capacity should be removed immediately from office billets and deployed to field billets to maximize law enforcement capacity. ", "Compliance for Grants and Other Federal Funding. ", "The next Administration should take steps to restore lawfulness and integrity to the department\u2019s\nmassive regimen of federal grant programs, most of which are managed and distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ", "The Secretary should direct FEMA to ensure that all FEMA-issued grant funding for states, localities, and private organizations is going to recipients who are lawful actors, can demonstrate that they are in compliance with federal law, and can show that their mission and actions support the broader homeland security mission. ", "All applicants and potential recipients of such grant funding should be required to meet certain preconditions for eligibility (except for receipt of post-disaster or nonhumanitarian funding) or should simply be considered ineligible for funding. ", "Such preconditions should include at least the following: ", "Certification by applicants that they comply with all aspects of federal immigration laws, including the honoring of all immigration detainers. ", "Certification by applicants that they are both registered with E-Verify and using E-Verify in a transparent and nonevasive manner. ", "For states and localities, that would include certification that all components of that government, and not just the applicant agency, are registered with and use E-Verify. ", "l If the applicant is a state or locality, commitment by that state or locality to total information-sharing in the context of both federal law enforcement and immigration enforcement. ", "This would include access to department of motor vehicles and voter registration databases. ", "Non-Use of Discretionary Guest Worker Visa Authorities. ", "To stop facilitating the availability of cheap foreign labor in order to support American workers\n(particularly poor and middle-class American workers) and follow congressional intent, the Secretary should explicitly cease using at least two discretionary authorities as part of his or her broader effort to support American workers. ", "l The Secretary should make it clear that he or she will not use the Secretary\u2019s existing discretionary authority to increase the number of H-2B (seasonal non-agricultural) visas above the statutorily set cap. ", "l The Secretary should not issue any regulations in support of the \u201cH-2 eligible\u201d country list, the effect of which would prevent favoring certain foreign nationals seeking an H-2 guest worker visa based simply on their nationality. ", "Restoration of Honesty and Transparency. ", "The Secretary should use his or\nher inherent authority as leader of the department to follow up with congressional and other partners to disclose information and provide the transparency that has been obstructed during the Biden Administration. ", "The Secretary should proceed from the assumption that congressional inquiries and public information requests were unfulfilled and then seek to fulfill them. ", "Replacement of the Entire Homeland Security Advisory Committee. ", "The\nSecretary should plan to quickly remove all current members of the Homeland Security Advisory Committee and replace them as quickly as is feasible. ", "U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP)\n", "If all immigration agencies are not merged, including USCIS and ORR, then an appropriate third alternative would be to consolidate ICE and CBP to form a combined Border Security and Immigration Agency (BSIA). ", "This would integrate critical interdiction, enforcement, and investigative resources, enhancing coordination and refocusing collective efforts on the vast and complex cross-border threats impacting our nation\u2019s health, safety, and national security. ", "It would also simultaneously add efficiencies to our nation\u2019s capacity to facilitate lawful trade and travel. ", "The BSIA should establish clear mission requirements, responsibilities, and mandates under existing law regarding the persistent need for and utilization of U.S. military personnel and resources to assist BSIA with increasing whole-of-government efforts and long-term strategy to secure our nation\u2019s borders effectively. ", "In addition, appropriate elements within the newly created BSIA should be designated as part of the U.S. National Security and Intelligence Community. ", "A conservative Administration should eliminate any prohibitive guidance, direction, or mandate from DHS or the Administration that curtails or limits CBP from publishing detailed border security and enforcement data not impacting intelligence, interdiction, and investigative operations, methods, or sources. ", "DHS should issue a regulation mandating that CBP publish accurate and timely border security data, readily available to the public, on a regular basis that avoid White House and DHS leadership review and approval. ", "The White House should grant the authority for CBP and DHS executives to utilize component aviation assets under the Office of Air and Marine (OAM). ", "CBP and DHS have worldwide missions with personnel and facilities that are deployed across the globe and in every state in the U.S. ", "With a CBP workforce alone of more than 60,000 people (240,000-plus for DHS) encompassing more than a thousand sea, land, and airports, it is essential that the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Secretary, and Deputy Secretary can travel efficiently to facilities to maintain appropriate situational awareness across the department\u2019s vast mission set and interact with the expansive workforce. ", "Although CBP operates one of the largest aviation components of any domestic U.S. law enforcement agency, executives are prohibited from utilizing the agency\u2019s aviation assets to facilitate official travel. ", "Executives are required to fly on commercial airlines, and this requirement significantly limits their ability to have classified communications and takes them offline for extended periods of time. ", "Border Patrol (BP) and OAM should be combined within CBP. ", "BP has more than 20,000 personnel, and OAM has approximately 1,800. ", "OAM\u2019s assets are dedicated in support of BP operations the vast majority of the time, yet redundant approvals, strategies, and independent hierarchal commands serve as impediments to efficient and practical resource deployments. ", "CBP should restart and expand use of the horseback-mounted Border Patrol. ", "As part of this announcement, the Secretary should clear the records and personnel files of those who were falsely accused by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of whipping migrants and issue a formal apology on behalf of DHS and CBP. ", "The Secretary should combine the Office of Trade (OT) and Trade Relations with the Office of Field Operations (OFO). ", "The OT is the smallest of CBP\u2019s components, and its operational counterpart, OFO, has a workforce of more than 30,000. ", "OT\u2019s function is interwoven with that of its OFO operational counterpart. ", "Combining OT with OFO would achieve streamlined operations and increase OT\u2019s capacity and capability by leveraging OFO\u2019s expansive resources. ", "CBP, ICE, and USCIS all have authority to issue Notices to Appear (NTA) to removable aliens in their presence, which begins removal proceedings. ", "In most instances, CBP should turn illegal aliens over to ICE for detention, and ICE can then issue any needed NTA. ", "CBP should issue NTAs only in limited situations for humanitarian reasons, such as medical emergencies. ", "In addition, CBP should eliminate use of Notices to Report (NTR) altogether. ", "CBP\u2019s established national standards of Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS) have been widely interpreted and expanded by lower courts. ", "This has resulted in unrealistic and differing detention standards for CBP facilities based on the jurisdiction within which they fall, negatively impacting operations. ", "ICE has suffered similarly. ", "A single nationwide detention standard should be codified that prevents individual states from mandating that federal government agencies adhere to widely expansive and ever-changing sets of standards. ", "Such standards should allow the flexibility to use large numbers of temporary facilities such as tents. ", "The annual costs associated with establishing and maintaining temporary facilities to address the flow of illegal migration and associated care, transportation, and processing are prohibitive, and CBP\u2019s budget is inadequate. ", "CBP is forced to forgo critical mission-essential endeavors to fund the additional associated costs. ", "Often, this requires the reprogramming of funding at the DHS level, which has a negative impact on other DHS components\u2019 operations. ", "This predictable cost that has to be paid from existing CBP and DHS funding levels reduces CBP\u2019s operational readiness and ability to accomplish its diverse and critical missions to protect the American people. ", "The next President should request a realistic budget that fully pays for these costs. ", "Increased funding is needed for BP to hire additional support personnel, which would relieve uniformed BP agents from administrative duties associated with processing aliens and allow them to return to their national security mission.

", "The State Department\u2019s reaction time to other countries\u2019 changes in visa policies with respect to the U.S. must be streamlined to ensure it can be updated in real time.

", "Recalcitrant countries that do not accept receipt of their returned nationals will risk the suspension of issuance of all immigrant visas, all nonimmigrant visas, or all visas. ", "These country-specific sanctions should remain in place until the sanctioned country accepts the return of all its removal-pending nationals and formally commits to future, regular acceptance of its nationals. ", "Blackletter implementation of this law will demonstrate a heretofore lacking seriousness to the international community that other nations must respect U.S. immigration laws and work with federal authorities to accept returning nationals\u2014or lose access to the United States. ", "Rightsizing refugee admissions. ", "The Biden Administration has\nengineered what is nothing short of a collapse of U.S. border security and interior immigration enforcement. ", "This Administration\u2019s humanitarian crisis\u2014which is arguably the greatest humanitarian crisis in the modern era, one which has harmed Americans and foreign nationals alike\u2014will take many years and billions of dollars to fully address. ", "One casualty of the Biden Administration\u2019s behavior will be the current form of the U.S. Refugee Admission Program (USRAP). ", "The federal government\u2019s obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions. ", "The State Department\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which administers USRAP, must shift its resources to challenges stemming from the current immigration situation until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored. ", "Strengthening bilateral and multilateral immigration-focused\nagreements.

", "For example, the Obama Administration\u2019s 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly referred to as the Iran nuclear deal, gave the Islamic regime a crucial monetary lifeline after the Green Movement protests in 2009, which, while ultimately unsuccessful, did succeed in weakening the regime and showing the world that younger Iranians want freedom. ", "Instead of pressuring the Iranian theocracy to move toward democracy, the Obama Administration threw the brutal regime an economic lifeline by giving hundreds of billions of dollars to the Iranian government and providing other sanctions relief. ", "This economic relief did not moderate the regime, but emboldened its brutality, its efforts to expand its nuclear weapons programs, and its support for global terrorism. ", "Former President Obama has admitted his lack of support for the Green Movement during his Administration was an error and blamed it on poor advisors\u2014yet those same advisors are involved with the Biden Administration\u2019s insistence on reducing pressure on the theocracy and resurrecting a nuclear deal.

", "Such reorganization could be creative, but also carefully review specific structure-related problems that have been documented over the years. ", "This reorganization effort would necessarily assess what office closures can be carried out with and without congressional approval. ", "Timelines for action on these fronts should be developed accordingly, but speed should be a priority. ", "Consolidate foreign assistance authorities. ", "Foreign assistance is a\ncritical foreign policy tool that is too often disconnected from the federal government\u2019s practice of foreign policy. ", "Bureaucrats spend significant energy resisting the use of non-emergency foreign assistance to leverage positive results for the United States, even though it is a perfectly reasonable proposition. ", "The coordination of foreign assistance dollars is also difficult because the foreign assistance budget and foreign loan issuance authorities are divided across numerous Cabinet departments, smaller agencies, and other offices. ", "The next Administration should take steps to ensure that future foreign assistance clearly and unambiguously supports the President\u2019s foreign policy agenda. ", "For example, the next administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is technically subordinate to the State Department, should be authorized to take on the additional role of Director of Foreign Assistance with the rank of Deputy Secretary and oversee all foreign assistance. ", "This role\u2014which existed briefly during the George W. Bush Administration before it was eliminated by the Obama Administration\u2014would empower the dual-hatted official to better align and coordinate with the manifold foreign assistance programs across the federal government. ", "The next Administration should also evaluate whether these multiple sources of foreign assistance are in the national interest and, if not, develop a plan to consolidate foreign assistance authorities. ", "Make public diplomacy and international broadcasting serve\nAmerican interests. ", "A key part of U.S. foreign policy is the ability to\ncommunicate with not only governments but with the peoples of the world. ", "Indeed, in some ways, communicating directly with the public is more important than communicating with governments, particularly in times of governmental conflict or disagreement. ", "Public diplomacy has historically been, and remains, vital to American foreign policy success. ", "Unfortunately, U.S. public diplomacy, which largely relies on taxpayer-funded international broadcasting outlets, has been deeply ineffective in recent years. ", "The U.S. government\u2019s first foray into international broadcasting started with the Voice of America radio broadcast in 1942, which was intended as a tool to communicate directly with the people of Europe during World War II. ", "During the next half-century, America\u2019s international broadcasting efforts both expanded and increased in sophistication as the United States shifted out of its \u201chot\u201d war in Europe and into the Cold War with the Soviet Union.

", "Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of Soviet and Eastern Bloc Communism, factors including the false appeal of a so-called peace dividend triggered a slide in the U.S. ability to communicate a pro-freedom message to the rest of the world and in its commitment to do so. ", "Ironically, this slide accompanied the rise of the Internet and mobile phone technologies, which arguably facilitated the most significant revolution in human communication since the invention of the printing press.

", "9/11 Commission Executive Director Philip Zelikow warned in a 2004 hearing that creating a new agency \u201clacking any existing institutional base\u2026would require authorities at least as strong as those we have proposed or else it would create a bureaucratic fifth wheel that would make the present situation even worse.\u201d", "6 ", "The ODNI has become that bureaucratic fifth wheel about which Zelikow warned.

", "Finally, the human resources and talent management systems for onboarding purposes at the ODNI, CIA, and some other elements of the IC are fundamentally broken.

", "But the problem is not confined to the executive branch struggle between the IC and policymakers; it also relates to the IC\u2019s relationship with Congress as evinced by DNI James Clapper\u2019s failure to answer honestly in response to congressional questions about government surveillance programs. ", "The ODNI and CIA are undergoing a crisis of confidence based on several factors. ", "First, President Barack Obama\u2019s CIA Director, John Brennan, gravely damaged the CIA by minimizing the Directorate of Operations and exploiting intelligence analysis as a political weapon after he left office. ", "Brennan's role in the letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials before the 2020 election is unclear, but in dismissing the Hunter Biden laptop as \u201cRussian disinformation,\u201d the CIA was discredited, and the shocking extent of politicization among some former IC officials was revealed. ", "Restoring respect for the IC as an independent provider of information and analysis while also ensuring that it is responsive to the legitimate needs of policymakers will require reinforcing essential norms and institutions. ", "However, we should also recognize that achieving the perfect balance that avoids the pathologies of too much distance or too much closeness and responsiveness to policymakers is not only difficult, but probably impossible.", "22 ", "Thus, given the very nature of the business and the political process, much will depend on the promotion of certain norms or virtues on both sides of the principal\u2013agent relationship. ", "Specifically: ", "The DNI and CIA Director should use their authority under the National Security Act of 1947 to expedite the clearance of personnel to meet mission needs and remove IC employees who have abused their positions of trust.

", "As Severino writes, \u201cFunding for scientific research should not be controlled by a small group of highly paid and unaccountable insiders at the NIH, many of whom stay in power for decades. ", "The NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken.\u201d ", "What\u2019s more, NIH has long \u201cbeen at the forefront in pushing junk gender science.\u201d ", "The next HHS secretary should immediately put an end to the department\u2019s foray into woke transgender activism.

", "Severino writes that the \u201cFDA should\u2026reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs because the politicized approval process was illegal from the start.\u201d ", "In addition, HHS programs often violate the spirit, and sometimes the letter, of conscience-protection laws.

", "The federal government should\nnot be in the central planning business, and the sugar program is a prime example of harmful central planning. ", "Its very purpose is to limit the sugar supply in order to increase prices.

", "Farmers eligible to\nparticipate in ARC or PLC are generally already able to purchase federal crop insurance, policies that protect against shortfalls in expected revenue whether caused by lower prices or smaller harvests. ", "The ARC program is especially egregious because farmers are being protected from shallow losses, which is another way of saying minor dips in expected revenue. ", "This is hardly consistent with the concept of providing a safety net to help farmers when they fall on hard times.

", "One of the most widely supported and bipartisan policy reforms is to reduce the premium subsidy that taxpayers are forced to pay.", "48 At a minimum, taxpayers should not pay more than 50 percent of the premium. ", "After all, taxpayers should not have to pay more than the farmers who benefit from the crop insurance policies. ", "CBO has found that reducing the premium subsidy to 47 percent would save $8.1 billion over 10 years and have little impact on crop insurance participation or on the number of covered acres.", "49 In that analysis, there would be a reduction in insured acres of just one-half of 1 percent, and only 1.5 percent of acres would have lower coverage levels. ", "50 ", "This reform is basically all benefit with little to no cost.

", "Burke\n", "MISSION\n", "Federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Depart ment of Education should be eliminated. ", "When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government. ", "In our pluralistic society, families and students should be free to choose from a diverse set of school options and learning environments that best fit their needs. ", "Our postsecondary institutions should also reflect such diversity, with room for not only \u201ctraditional\u201d liberal arts colleges and research universities but also faith-based institutions, career schools, military academies, and lifelong learning programs. ", "Elementary and secondary education policy should follow the path outlined by Milton Friedman in 1955, wherein education is publicly funded but education decisions are made by families. ", "Ultimately, every parent should have the option to direct his or her child\u2019s share of education funding through an education savings account (ESA), funded overwhelmingly by state and local taxpayers, which would empower parents to choose a set of education options that meet their child's unique needs. ", "States are eager to lead in K\u201312 education. ", "For decades, they have acted independently of the federal government to pioneer a variety of constructive reforms and school choice programs. ", "For example, in 2011, Arizona first piloted ESAs, which provide families roughly 90 percent of what the state would have spent on that child in public school to be used instead on education options such as private school tuition, online courses, and tutoring. ", "In 2022, Arizona expanded the program to be available to all families. ", "The future of education freedom and reform in the states is bright and will shine brighter when regulations and red tape from Washington are eliminated. ", "Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes. ", "It raises the cost of education without raising student achievement. ", "To the extent that federal taxpayer dollars are used to fund education programs, those funds should be blockgranted to states without strings, eliminating the need for many federal and state bureaucrats. ", "Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families. ", "Although student loans and grants should ultimately be restored to the private sector (or, at the very least, the federal government should revisit its role as a guarantor, rather than direct lender) federal postsecondary education investments should bolster economic growth, and recipient institutions should nourish academic freedom and embrace intellectual diversity. ", "That has not, however, been the track record of federal higher education policy or of the many institutions of higher education that are hostile to free expression, open academic inquiry, and American exceptionalism. ", "Federal postsecondary policy should be more than massive, inefficient, and open-ended subsidies to \u201ctraditional\u201d colleges and universities. ", "It should be rebalanced to focus far more on bolstering the workforce skills of Americans who have no interest in pursuing a fouryear academic degree. ", "It should reflect a fuller picture of learning after high school, placing apprenticeship programs of all types and career and technical education on an even playing field with degrees from colleges and universities. ", "Rather than continuing to buttress a higher education establishment captured by woke \u201cdiversicrats\u201d and a de facto monopoly enforced by the federal accreditation cartel, federal postsecondary education policy should prepare students for jobs in the dynamic economy, nurture institutional diversity, and expose schools to greater market forces.", "1 ", "OVERVIEW\n", "For most of our history, the federal government played a minor role in education. Then, over a 14-month period beginning in 1964, Congress planted the seeds for what would become the U.S. Department of Education (ED or the department). ", "In July of that year, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964, after Congress reached a consensus that the mistreatment of black Americans was no longer tolerable and merited a federal response. ", "In the case of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA)2 and the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA),3 Congress sought to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged students by providing additional compensatory funding for low-income children and lower-income college students. ", "Spending on ESEA and the HEA\u2014part of Johnson\u2019s \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d\u2014grew exponentially in the years that followed. ", "By Fiscal Year 2022, ESEA programs received $27.7 billion in appropriations, in addition to $190 billion that came through the pandemic\u2019s Elementary and Secondary Schools Emergency Relief (ESSER) Funds,4 which relied on ESEA formulas. ", "The same year, the department spent more than $2 billion just to administer Title IV of the HEA, which authorizes federal student loans and Pell grants. ", "It provided $22.5 billion in Pell grants, and it oversaw outlays of close to $100 billion in direct student loans. ", "Since 1965, Congress has continued to layer on dozens of new laws and programs as federal \u201csolutions\u201d to myriad education problems. ", "In 1973, it passed the Rehabilitation Act,5 and, in 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)6 to address educational neglect of students with disabilities. ", "In 2002, it created the Institute for Education Sciences to consolidate education data collection and fund research. ", "Congress has also enacted a series of Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Acts, including Perkins V in 2018.", "7 Congress could have, and once did, distribute management of federal education programs outside of a single department. ", "But for those interested in expanding federal funding and influence in education, this unconsolidated approach was less than ideal, because a single, captive agency would allow them to promote their agenda more effectively across Administrations. ", "Eventually, the National Education Association made a deal and backed the right presidential candidate\u2014 ", "Jimmy Carter\u2014who successfully lobbied for and delivered the Cabinet-level agency.

", "It has had the opposite effect. ", "Instead, special interest groups like the National Education Association (NEA), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and the higher education lobby have leveraged the agency to continuously expand federal expenditures\u2014a desirable funding stream from their vantage point because federal budgets are not constrained like state and local budgets that must be balanced each year. ", "By FY 2022, the department\u2019s discretionary and mandatory appropriation topped $80 billion, not including student loan outlays.

", "The next Administration will need a plan to redistribute the various congressionally approved federal education programs across the government, eliminate those that are ineffective or duplicative, and then eliminate the unproductive red tape and rules by entrusting states and districts with flexible, formula-driven block grants. ", "This chapter details that plan. ", "As the next Administration executes its work, it should be guided by a few core principles, including: ", "Advancing education freedom. ", "Empowering families to choose among\na diverse set of education options is key to reform and improved outcomes, and it can be achieved without establishing a new federal program.

", "As\nWashington begins to downsize its intervention in education, existing funding should be sent to states as grants over which they have full control, enabling states to put federal funding toward any lawful education purpose under state law. ", "Treating taxpayers like investors in federal student aid. ", "Taxpayers\nshould expect their investments in higher education to generate economic productivity. ", "When the federal government lends money to individuals for a postsecondary education, taxpayers should expect those borrowers to repay.

", "Currently the Department of Education relies on graduation rates and average earnings as proxies for educational quality. ", "Both of those outcomes, however, are highly dependent upon a student\u2019s socioeconomic background, sex, family status, and other factors. ", "Colleges and universities with selective admissions policies post the strongest outcomes, primarily because they admit mostly low-risk, traditional students. ", "Open enrollment institutions post the weakest outcomes, largely because life is challenging and complicated for low-income and non-traditional students, who may be forced to drop out when a work schedule changes, a child needs more attention, or an unexpected repair or medical bill makes continuing impossible. ", "Such confounding factors make it difficult to isolate the impact of educational quality versus socioeconomic factors on student outcomes. ", "The Department of Health and Human Services faced similar challenges in trying to evaluate healthcare outcomes since social determinants of health result in worse health outcomes among those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, have low educational attainment levels, have struggled with addiction, or have poor diet and exercise habits. ", "Without risk adjustment of outcomes, hospitals treating wealthy patients will always appear to be delivering good care, and hospitals treating low-income patients will appear to be delivering poor care.

", "Families\ncomprised of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of a well-ordered nation and healthy society.

", "When it comes to testing, the CDC\u2019s role should similarly be to facilitate rather than supplant the efforts of private test developers, academic laboratories, state public health laboratories, and clinical testing providers. ", "When responding to a novel pathogen, the CDC should focus on gathering and disseminating information, including specimens needed for development of positive controls and reference panels, and ensuring that test developers can develop and validate diagnostic tests.

", "Even today, more than a half-century after Congress put enforcement of so-called fair housing in the hands of the HUD bureaucracy, implementation of this policy is muddled by the repeated application of affirmative race-based policies. ", "Also, the production mandate for HUD\u2019s housing portfolio has waned for decades with the department effectively working to maintain the public housing portfolio from the late 1990s when the Faircloth Amendment capped HUD\u2019s public housing portfolio.", "43 ", "Longer-term reforms of HUD rental assistance programs should encourage choice and competition for renters, encourage participation by landlords where appropriate,", "44 and encourage all non-elderly, able-bodied adults to move toward self-sufficiency. ", "This can be pursued through regulations and legislative reforms that seek to strengthen work requirements, limit the period during which households are eligible for housing benefits, and add flexibility to rent payment terms to facilitate the movement of households toward self-sufficiency. ", "Obviously, using government vouchers or other such programs to expand housing choice options is not without its downsides. ", "The turn toward mobility vouchers constitutes an abandonment of America\u2019s public housing stock, and efforts to increase competition in the public housing market must not come at the expense of local autonomy and the ability of cities, towns, neighborhoods, and communities to choose for themselves the sort of housing they want to allow. ", "Freedom of association and self-government at the most local level possible must remain primary considerations in any conservative effort to increase competition in the public housing market. ", "Congress should also consider those areas in which federal policy negatively interacts with private markets, including when federal policy crowds out private-sector development and exacerbates affordability challenges that persist across the nation. ", "It is essential that legislation provides states and localities maximal flexibility to pursue locally designed policies and minimize the likelihood of federal preemption of local land use and zoning decisions. ", "In the same manner, Congress should prioritize any and all legislative support for the single-family home. ", "Homeownership forms the backbone of the American Dream. ", "The purchase of a home is the largest investment most Americans will make in their lifetimes, and homeownership remains the most accessible way to build generational wealth for millions of Americans. ", "For these reasons, American homeowners and citizens know best what is in the interest of their neighborhoods and communities. ", "Localities rather than the federal government must have the final say in zoning laws and regulations, and a conservative Administration should oppose any efforts to weaken single-family zoning. ", "Along the same lines, Congress can propose tax credits for the renovation or repair of housing stock in rural areas so that more Americans are able to access the American Dream of homeownership. ", "Additionally, enhanced statutory authorities for local autonomy should extend to the prioritizing of federal rental assistance subsidies that emphasize choice and mobility in housing voucher subsidies over static, site-based subsidies and provide authority for maximal flexibility to direct PHA land sales that involve the existing stock of public housing units. ", "Congress must consider the future of the public housing model. ", "At best, any new public investments will provide maintenance funds to bring substandard housing units and properties up to livability standards but will still fail to address larger aims of upward mobility and dynamism for local housing markets where land can be sold by PHAs and put to greater economic use, thereby benefiting entire local economies through greater private investment, productivity and employment opportunities, and increased tax revenue. ", "Any long-term view of HUD\u2019s future must include maintaining the strong financial operations and reliable reporting that are needed to run a $50 billionper-year agency.

", "The department\u2019s auditors were unable to conclude that HUD\u2019s internal operations were producing accurate financial reporting. ", "The auditors had identified multiple material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in the department\u2019s internal financial controls. ", "Overall, the deterioration of HUD\u2019s financial infrastructure led to a lack of accountability with respect to the use of taxpayer funds as well as to pervasive difficulties with operations and program implementation. ", "However, by hiring a new CFO from the private sector with a proven track record of visionary leadership, HUD was able to implement an agencywide governance structure that improved its financial processes and internal controls and harnessed the power of innovative new technologies to bring a modernized business mindset to the agency\u2019s financial infrastructure. ", "By the end of the Trump Administration, for the first time in nearly a decade, HUD was able to address all of its previously identified material weaknesses, and the auditors were able to issue their first clean audit report on HUD\u2019s financial statements and internal controls. ", "Finally, and more fundamentally, Congress could consider a wholesale overhaul of HUD that contemplates devolving many HUD functions to states and localities with any remaining federal functions consolidated to other federal agencies (for example, by transferring loan guarantee programs to SBA; moving Indian housing programs to the Department of the Interior; moving rental assistance, mortgage insurance programs, and GNMA to a redesignated Housing and Home Finance Agency).

", "Transportation plays a vital role in the prosperity and flourishing of the United States. ", "Americans use trucks, tankers, and trains to keep our supply chains running and cars, transit, and planes to go where we want to go. ", "Two hundred and forty years ago, Adam Smith recognized that connections were a bedrock of society because they stimulate specialization, innovation, and capital investment. ", "In the following decades, America\u2019s growth was made possible by transportation\u2014first ports and transatlantic shipping, then roads, canals, and eventually railroads pushing westward to create the nation we call home. ", "Access to transportation is part of what made our country great. ", "The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), with a requested fiscal year (FY) 2023 budget of $142 billion,1 was originally intended simply to provide a policy framework for transportation safety, rulemaking, and regulation. ", "However, it has evolved to believe that its role is \u201cto deliver the world\u2019s leading transportation system\u201d2\u2014that is, to select individual projects and allocate taxpayer funds in the actual planning, developing, and building of transportation assets. ", "Such a role is held more appropriately by transportation asset owners: primarily states, municipalities, and the private sector. ", "In addition to providing a safety and regulatory framework through its 11 subcomponents, known as modes, the department has become a de facto grantmaking and lending organization. ", "DOT provides approximately $50 billion in discretionary and formula grants, known as obligations, annually in areas ranging from transit systems to road construction to universities and has lent or subsidized more than $60 billion since the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program,3 now managed by the Build America Bureau, was created in 1998. ", "This evolved role as a major, and often primary, funding and financing source is far from the department\u2019s original policy framework. ", "It also removes incentives for state and local officials to ensure that investments are worthwhile, because federal money removes the need to get public buy-in to build and maintain infrastructure projects as funding becomes \u201csomeone else\u2019s money.\u201d ", "Despite the department\u2019s tremendous resources, congressional mandates and funding priorities have made it difficult for DOT to focus on the pressing transportation challenges that most directly affect average Americans, such as the high cost of personal automobiles, especially in an era of high inflation; unpredictable and expensive commercial shipping by rail, air, and sea; and infrastructure spending that does not match the types of transportation that most Americans prefer. ", "Transforming the department to address the varied needs of all Americans more effectively remains a central challenge. ", "DOT is particularly difficult to manage because its 11 major components\u2014nine modal administrations, the Office of the Secretary, and the Office of the Inspector General\u2014all have their own sets of personnel including administrators, deputy administrators, chiefs of staff, and general counsels. ", "Most grants flow through the modes, such as the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and Federal Aviation Administration. ", "The Office of the Secretary contains its own grantmaking operation that funds research and some special grants, as well as a major lending operation, the Build America Bureau, that functions as an infrastructure bank. ", "The Office of the Secretary has department-wide offices for such functions as Budget and Financial Management, the General Counsel, Policy, the Office of Research and Technology, Government Affairs, Administration, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, Public Affairs, Drug and Alcohol Policy and Compliance, and Civil Rights. ", "The modal administrations include the: ", "Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); ", "Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); ", "Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); ", "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA); ", "Federal Transit Administration (FTA); ", "Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS); ", "Maritime Administration (MARAD); Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA); and Pipeline Safety and Hazardous Material Administration (PHMSA). ", "DOT\u2019s fundamental problem is that instead of being able to focus on providing Americans with affordable and abundant transportation, it has become saddled with congressional requirements that reduce the department to a de facto grantmaking organization. ", "Yet there is little need for much of this grantmaking, for two reasons: ", "New technology enables private companies to charge for transportation in many areas, which could transform how innovation is financed. ", "It is vital to consider the role of user fees and other pricing innovations with regard to transportation infrastructure. ", "Airport landing fees for aircraft, toll charges on roads and bridges, and per-gallon taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel are all examples of user charges that affect the decisions of transportation system users. ", "These changes could shift our nation\u2019s transportation away from being a top\u2013down system that is misaligned with the needs of so many Americans. ", "Increasing private-sector financing could revolutionize travel and increase everyday mobility to its greatest potential in a way that Americans prefer. ", "Doing so would keep transportation decisions out of the hands of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., who are far removed from local problems and preferences. ", "If funding must be federal, it would be more efficient for the U.S. Congress to send transportation grants to each of the 50 states and allow each state to purchase the transportation services that it thinks are best. ", "Such an approach would enable states to prioritize different types of transportation according to the needs of their citizens. ", "States that rely more on automotive transportation, for example, could use their funding to meet those needs. ", "Meanwhile, many Americans continue to confront serious challenges with their day-to-day transportation, including costs that have increased dramatically in recent years. ", "DOT in its current form is insufficiently equipped to address those problems. ", "DOT\u2019s discretionary grant-making processes should be abolished, and funding should be focused on formulaic distributions to the states, which know best their transportation needs and are incentivized to think of the long-term maintenance costs. ", "At a bare minimum, the number of grants should be consolidated. ", "DOT would also reduce unnecessary burdens by returning to the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201crule on rules\u201d approach to regulations, implemented in late 2019 as RIN 2105-AE84.4 This rule strengthened the Administration\u2019s effort to remove outdated regulations, find cost-saving reforms, and clarify that guidance documents are in fact guidance rather than mandatory impositions. ", "The Biden Administration unwisely moved away from this reform, and the next Administration should revive it without delay. ", "BUILD AMERICA BUREAU\n", "The Build America Bureau (BAB) resides within the Office of the Secretary and describes itself as \u201cresponsible for driving transportation infrastructure development projects in the United States.\u201d", "5 ", "This lofty-sounding goal in practice means that the Bureau serves as the point of contact for distributing funds for transportation projects in the form of subsidized 30-year loans. ", "For higher-quality projects and in certain circumstances, these government loans may disintermediate the private sector from providing similar financing, albeit at higher costs. ", "At certain times in the economic cycle, and for many lower-quality projects with more dubious economic return, similar loans from the private sector are simply not available. ", "Should the BAB continue to exist and potentially disintermediate the private financing sector, it must maintain underwriting discipline and continue best practices of requiring rigorous financial modeling and cushion for repayment of loans in a variety of economic scenarios. ", "In addition: ", "The BAB should ensure that these loans do not become grants in another form by maintaining the requirement that all project borrowers be rated at least investment grade by the major ratings agencies and that project sponsors remain liable to ensure that all financing is repaid, even in periods of financial stress and economic downturns. ", "Project sponsors should be required to show that projects have positive economic value to taxpayers, and sponsors should guarantee that all federal financing will be repaid through properly structured loan terms, including a minimum equity commitment from all project sponsors. ", "All projects should also be required to show repayment ability in various interest rate environments, and the BAB should ensure that long-term loans are structured appropriately with regard to the fixing of interest rates and hedging of interest rate risk on the part of the borrowers to avoid financial stress or default driven solely by rising interest rates. ", "Policymakers should maintain awareness and promote transparency regarding the continued existence of this loan program and whether private financiers are being disintermediated by the subsidized BAB lending that the private sector simply cannot match. ", "A cost-benefit analysis of the federal government\u2019s potential replacement and disintermediation of the private financing sector regarding infrastructure loans, which is not currently performed, should be conducted on a regular basis. ", "PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS\n", "Much infrastructure could be funded through public\u2013private partnerships (P3s), a procurement method that uses private financing to construct infrastructure. ", "In exchange for providing the financing, the private partner typically retains the right to operate the asset under requirements specified by the government in a contract called a concession agreement. ", "In addition, the private partner is given the right either to collect fees from the users of the asset or to receive a periodic payment from the government conditioned on the asset\u2019s availability: ", "If a highway is not open to traffic when it should be, for example, the government\u2019s payment to the private concessionaire is reduced. ", "The best practice for a government that is interested in using a P3 to deliver a project is for the government first to perform a value-for-money study, which compares the costs and benefits of procuring the asset under a typical procurement against the costs and benefits of utilizing a P3. ", "Since private equity is involved, the financing costs for P3s are higher, but they also are frequently more than offset by the private sector\u2019s ability to generate efficiencies and cost savings in the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of the asset. ", "If the value-for-money study finds that the efficiencies of a P3 and the value of risk shifted to the private sector exceed the additional financing costs, then utilizing a P3 is good public policy because Americans have better infrastructure at a lower cost. ", "As well as providing better transportation facilities for Americans, P3s offer a number of benefits to governments. ", "Specifically, they: ", "Provide access to some of the world\u2019s best talent with vast experience in delivering infrastructure, ", "Create incentives for innovation and creativity, ", "Shift unique project risks to companies that are familiar with those risks, and ", "Allow designers, contractors, and maintenance teams to work together through the delivery of the process to focus on lifecycle costs as opposed to just initial design and construction costs. ", "It should be noted that project funding and P3s are not synonymous. ", "Policymakers and government leaders frequently mistake the financing that P3s provide for funding. ", "A P3 allows the government to obtain equity from the private sector, but that equity has to be paid back with interest. ", "Like a loan, a P3 can be used to accelerate revenues and provide needed capital to help pay the upfront costs of a project, but also like a loan, the private P3 investors must be paid back for investors to realize a financial return. ", "Some mistakenly think that using a P3 would allow a road or bridge to be delivered without increases in tolls or taxes. ", "It is important to remember that all funding for governmental infrastructure comes from either taxes or user fees. ", "P3 financing can be used to make those funding sources more efficient, but it cannot replace the need for taxes or user fees to provide the funding for the project. ", "In addition, a poorly managed P3 procurement process (the process government uses to identify the best private P3 partner) can result in excessive consultant costs and years-long delays in delivery. ", "While P3s can offer efficiencies in delivering the project, the P3 procurement process itself can be significantly longer and more expensive than traditional procurement processes. ", "Finally, and possibly most important, a P3 gives a private party the ability to collect fees or payments over decades (a period well beyond the length of the careers of the political appointees who sign contracts with private parties). ", "Thus, P3s create an opportunity for current governmental leaders to obtain a higher upfront payment from the private party in exchange for greater user fees paid by future generations who will use the asset. ", "In other words, a governmental CEO (governor, mayor, head of an authority) can use a P3 to impose unnecessarily high costs on users decades in the future in exchange for upfront cash. ", "It is important that contracts be transparent in order to minimize this possibility. ", "A P3\u2019s greatest public value is realized when the procurement model is used for a project that is unusually risky or a type of project with which the government has limited experience such as a tunnel or light rail line. ", "P3s are an excellent tool for transferring risk from the public sector to the private sector and can create considerable value for the taxpaying public. ", "However, a high degree of expertise is required to ensure that the risk transfer warrants the higher financing and procurement costs that P3s impose. ", "EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES\n", "As private companies develop a future of new, emerging technologies, one role for DOT is driving clarity in the government\u2019s role and setting standards for safety, security, and privacy without hampering innovation. ", "DOT can oversee the testing and deployment of a wide variety of new technologies, allowing communities and individuals to choose what best fits their needs. ", "It is the role of the private sector, not the government, to pick winners and losers in technology development. ", "If a technology underperforms, the private sector should be liable, not the government. ", "The department should ensure a tech-neutral approach to addressing any emerging transportation technology while keeping safety as the number one priority. ", "As part of this, it should work to facilitate the safe and full integration of automated vehicles into the national transportation system. ", "Over time, these advanced technologies can save lives, transform personal mobility, and provide additional transportation opportunities\u2014including for people with disabilities, aging populations, and communities where car ownership is expensive or impractical. ", "NHTSA\u2019s and FMCSA\u2019s current regulations were written before the advent of automated vehicles and driving systems. ", "Both operating administrations have issued Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemakings (ANPRMs) that begin the process of updating their regulations to reflect this new technology. ", "However, these regulations have stalled under the Biden Administration, which has chosen to use the department\u2019s tools to get people to take transit and drive electric vehicles instead of helping people to choose the transportation options that suit them best. ", "NHTSA should work to remove regulatory barriers by focusing on updating vehicle standards as well as publishing performance-based rules for the operations of automated vehicles (AVs). ", "FMCSA should work to clarify the regulations to align with DOT\u2019s AV 3.0 guidance, which would allow the drivers to be safely removed from the operations of a commercial motor vehicle. ", "From a nonregulatory point of view, DOT has pivoted from a successful focus on the voluntary sharing of data to improve safety outcomes to adoption of a more compulsory and antagonistic approach to mandating data collection and publication through a Standing General Order related to automated vehicles. ", "This needs to be reversed. ", "Many of these new and innovative technologies rely on wireless communications that depend on the availability and purchase of radio frequency spectrum, a trend that is consistent with what we see in connectivity in our everyday lives. ", "There is a role for DOT in ensuring that in the fight over spectrum, transportation gets its fair share. ", "For technologies to work in transportation, and in particular to work for transportation safety, they have to meet the unique needs of a transportation environment. ", "They need to account for rapidly moving and out-of-line-of-sight vehicles as well as pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. ", "They should account for the potential for radio interference, and they should address security. ", "This is why in 1999, in response to a request from Congress, the Federal Communications Commission allocated the 5.9 GHz band of spectrum to traffic safety and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). ", "In 2020, the FCC took away 45 MHz of the 75 MHz it had added, leaving only 30 MHz for transportation safety and ITS. ", "DOT needs to represent the transportation community and make the case for needed spectrum to the public and Congress. ", "CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE) ", "STANDARDS\n", "One reason for the high numbers of injuries on American roadways is that national fuel economy standards raise the price of cars, disincentivizing people from purchasing newer, safer vehicles. ", "Congress requires the Secretary of Transportation to set national fuel economy standards for new motor vehicles sold in the United States. ", "This mandate was established in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA),6 a law passed in the wake of the Arab oil embargo to promote greater energy efficiency and lessen the national security threat of U.S. dependence on foreign oil. ", "The statute directs DOT to prescribe the \u201cmaximum feasible\u201d mileage requirements for different categories of internal-combustion engine (ICE) automobiles for each model year. ", "The standards must be achievable using available ICE technologies running on gasoline, diesel fuel, or similar combustible fuels and must not be set so high as to prevent automakers from profitably producing new vehicles at sufficient volume to meet consumer demand. ", "Congress recognized that the ICE-powered automobile has been instrumental to advancing the mobility and prosperity of the American people and that the domestic mass production of new ICE vehicles generates millions of jobs and remains critical to the overall health of the U.S. economy and the strength of the nation\u2019s industrial base. ", "Accordingly, Congress took care to ensure that the mileage requirements issued by DOT would not undermine the vitality of America\u2019s auto industry or interfere with the market economics that drives consumer demand for new vehicles. ", "This rulemaking authority, which has been delegated by the Secretary to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is exclusive to DOT. ", "EPCA expressly preempts states from adopting or enforcing any different requirement \u201crelated to fuel economy standards\u201d for new motor vehicles. ", "While the statute instructs DOT to consult with the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in formulating its standards, no other federal agency, including EPA, has clear authority to set fuel economy requirements in place of NHTSA. ", "The Clean Air Act7 gives EPA general authority to establish emissions limits for new motor vehicles for air pollutants that are found to pose a danger to humans. ", "However, there is no reason to believe Congress ever contemplated that EPA\u2019s authority to address automotive air pollution might be used to displace or supersede NHTSA\u2019s fuel economy mandate under EPCA. ", "Congress chose to assign the power to set fuel economy standards to DOT rather than EPA. ", "This was not only because DOT understands the technologies and economics of the auto industry, but also because NHTSA is the nation\u2019s leading motor vehicle safety regulator, and Congress sought to ensure that fuel economy requirements would not adversely affect highway safety. ", "Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has flouted these statutory limitations in nearly every respect. ", "The predictable result is higher expected transportation costs for Americans. ", "In pursuit of an anti\u2013fossil fuel climate agenda never approved by Congress, the Biden Administration has raised fuel economy requirements to levels that cannot realistically be met by most categories of ICE vehicles. ", "The purpose is to force the auto industry to transition away from traditional technologies to the production of electric vehicles (EVs) and compel Americans to accept costly EVs despite a clear and persistent consumer preference for ICE-powered vehicles. ", "In further support of this agenda, federal regulators administer a scheme of generous fuel economy credits that subsidize EV producers such as Tesla at the expense of legacy automakers. ", "Moreover, and contrary to Congress\u2019s design, the Biden EPA has been given preeminence in the regulation of fuel economy through the setting of carbon dioxide emissions limits for new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. ", "Because carbon dioxide emissions levels correspond to mileage in automobiles powered by fossil fuels, these EPA rules are de facto fuel economy requirements that apply independently of NHTSA\u2019s standards. ", "The Biden Administration has also granted California a special waiver under the Clean Air Act that permits the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to issue its own fuel economy directives, notwithstanding EPCA\u2019s prohibition on state standards. ", "Under this waiver, CARB has ordered automakers to phase out the sale of ICE-powered automobiles in California and transition to the production of zero-emission vehicles by 2035. ", "The Clean Air Act allows other states to follow California\u2019s requirements; thus, CARB is effectively determining fuel economy policies for the entire nation. ", "As a result of these regulatory actions, automobiles will be significantly more expensive to produce, there will be fewer affordable new vehicle options for American families, and fewer new vehicles will be sold in the U.S. ", "That will do more than translate into a loss of auto industry jobs for American workers: ", "It will also mean a significant increase in traffic deaths and injuries. ", "As fewer new cars are purchased, the price of used cars will rise, and more Americans will be left driving older cars, which traffic statistics show are much less safe than newer vehicles. ", "NHTSA itself has acknowledged that the Biden Administration\u2019s fuel economy standards will generate hundreds of additional fatalities and thousands of additional injuries on U.S. highways. ", "Because older cars also produce more harmful air pollution, the aging of America\u2019s fleet will also have negative consequences for air quality.

", "This means that when individuals change their commutes from urban buses to rideshare or electric scooter, the use of public transit decreases. ", "A better definition for public transit (which also would require congressional legislation) would be transit provided for the public rather than transit provided by a public municipality.

", "Mass transit has been the slowest mode to recover, with October 2022 ridership reaching only 64 percent of the level seen in October 2019. ", "The sustained increase in remote work has caused changes in commuting patterns. ", "Since facilitating travel for workers is one of the core functions of mass transit systems, a permanent reduction in commuting raises questions about the viability of fixed-route mass transit, especially considering that transit systems required substantial subsidization before the pandemic. ", "Regrettably, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act13 authorized tens of billions of dollars for the expansion of transit systems even as Americans were moving away from them and into personal vehicles. ", "Lower revenue from reduced ridership is already driving transit agencies to a budgetary breaking point, and added operational costs from system expansions will make this problem worse. ", "The Capital Investment Grants (CIG) program is another example of Washington\u2019s tendency to fund transit expansion rather than maintaining or improving current facilities. ", "The CIG program, which began in 1991, funds only novel transit projects. ", "These can include new rail lines (regardless of the demand for preexisting rail in the area) and costly operations such as streetcars. ", "Because Americans have demonstrated a strong preference for alternative means of transportation, rather than throwing good money after bad by continuing federal subsidies for transit expansion, there should be a focus on reducing costs that make transit uneconomical. ", "The Trump Administration urged Congress to eliminate the CIG program, but the program has strong support on Capitol Hill. ", "At a minimum, a new conservative Administration should ensure that each CIG project meets sound economic standards and a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. ", "The largest expense in transit operational budgets is labor. ", "Compensation costs for transit workers exceed both regional and sector compensation averages. ", "This is driven by generous pension and health benefits rather than by exorbitant wages. ", "Since workers value wages more than they value fringe benefits, this has led to a perverse situation in which transit agencies have high compensation costs yet are struggling to attract workers. ", "The next Administration can remove the largest obstacle to reforming labor costs. ", "Section 10(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 196414 was initially intended to protect bargaining rights for workers in privately owned transit systems that were being absorbed by government-operated agencies. ", "The provision has mutated into a requirement that any transit agency receiving federal funds cannot reduce compensation, an interpretation that far exceeds the original statute. ", "Returning to the original intent would allow transit agencies to adjust fringe benefits without fearing a federal lawsuit. ", "It is also vital to move away from using the Highway Trust Fund to prop up mass transit. ", "The fund was driven into insolvency (and repeated bailouts) through decades of transfers to transit without any increase in transit usage to show for it.

", "Although FRA could adopt a modern inspection program that takes advantage of technological ways to inspect track, it is refusing to amend 50-year-old track inspection requirements, leaving customers with higher costs. ", "FRA is refusing to take final action on a rulemaking proceeding that would modernize brake inspection requirements by taking advantage of the ability to track brake inspections on rolling stock electronically instead of by using paper air brake slips, which would enable extending the interval between brake inspections for trains and eliminating restrictions on the ability to place/remove blocks of cars in trains. ", "FRA will be proposing certification requirements for dispatchers and signal employees despite the failure of the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC) to identify any safety benefit. ", "FRA is planning to propose emergency escape breathing apparatus requirements for train crews even though FRA staff long ago concluded that the costs of these requirements would far outweigh their very minimal benefits. ", "It is vital that the integrity of FRA\u2019s research program be preserved. ", "In 2022, FRA switched the management of the Transportation Technology Center (TTC) in Pueblo, Colorado, from a subsidiary of the Association of American Railroads (AAR) to Ensco, Inc. ", "FRA seems determined to direct research to TTC, even when there are better choices with respect to the research in question, in an effort to support TTC financially and justify its decision to change management at TTC. ", "This change in approach threatens the collaborative approach to research between FRA and the railroads that has existed for decades.

", "Serious consideration should be given to repealing or substantially reforming the Jones Act,16 which would require legislation. ", "The economic costs of the Jones Act, which is notionally in place to promote a robust Merchant Marine, vastly exceed its effect on the supply of domestic ships. ", "For instance, no liquified natural gas (LNG) can be shipped from Alaska to the lower 48 states because there are no U.S.-flagged ships that carry LNG. ", "If there are genuine concerns about U.S. fleet capacity in the absence of the Jones Act, it would be possible to do so through an expansion of the Defense Reserve Fleet. ", "Another DHS agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is a frequent user of MARAD Ready Reserve Force shipping during disaster assistance missions. ", "Transferring MARAD to DHS would make coordination and requisition of those vessels a smoother and more rapid process. ", "DHS has responsibility for reviewing and approving Jones Act waivers. ", "This process first requires a market survey of available shipping tonnage that is completed by MARAD. ", "The processing of Jones Act waiver requests would be streamlined if both agencies were in the same department. ", "Finally, DHS as a department is experienced in administering and budgeting for the operation of an existing federal service academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, which is similar to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in size.

", "OVERVIEW\nAt the end of the Obama Administration, the VA was held in low esteem both by the veterans it served and by the employees who served these former warriors. ", "Eroding morale caused by the downstream effects of a health care access crisis in 2014 led to the resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki and extensive oversight investigations by Congress from 2015\u20132016. ", "By 2020, however, the VA had become one of the most respected U.S. agencies. ", "This significant progress was due in part to the leadership of Secretary Robert Wilkie (2018\u20132021) and his team of political appointees and career senior executives, many of them veterans, who led the effort to ensure that the VA became \u201cVeteran-centric\u201d in its governance decisions and fostered a more positive work environment. ", "This mindset translated into a department that was better attuned to employees\u2019 and veterans\u2019 needs and experiences in the daily operations of health care, benefits, and memorial affairs. ", "During that period, the VA received the largest number of watershed congressional authorizations to reform its health care and benefits that it had received since the post\u2013Vietnam War years along with historic increases in annual appropriations, which have tripled since the last full year of the George W. Bush Administration. ", "The current VA leadership team of Biden appointees has adopted some of their predecessors\u2019 governance processes. ", "However, they have not sustained the previous Administration\u2019s commitment to a genuine \u201cVeteran-centric\u201d philosophy, most notably with respect to the delivery of health care, and harbor a bias toward expanding the unionized federal employee workforce that has not always been aligned with a focus on \u201cVeteran-centric\u201d care. ", "There also is growing concern in Congress and the veteran community that the VA is poorly managing and in some cases disregarding provisions of the VA MISSION [Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks] Act of 20182 that codify broad access for veterans to non-VA health care providers. ", "Efforts to expand disability benefits to large populations without adequate planning have caused an erosion of veterans\u2019 trust in the VA enterprise. ", "Additionally, the current VA leadership is focusing very publicly on \u201csocial equity and inclusion\u201d within departmental policy discussions toward ends that will affect only a small minority of the veterans who use the VA. ", "For the first time, the VA is allowing access to abortion services, a medical procedure unrelated to military service that the VA lacks the legal authority and clinical proficiency to perform.

", "DEPARTMENTAL HISTORY\n", "Following the Civil War, state veterans homes were established to provide medical and hospital treatment for all injuries and diseases. ", "When the United States entered World War I in 1917, \u201cCongress established a new system of Veterans benefits, including programs for disability compensation, insurance for service personnel and Veterans, and vocational rehabilitation for the disabled\u201d3 that was overseen by three different federal programs: the Veterans Bureau, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Pensions, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. ", "In 1921, Congress combined those programs into the Veterans Bureau. ", "Following World War II, a national VA hospital system, much of which remains operational today, was established to care for millions of returning veterans. ", "Following the Vietnam War, the VA\u2019s federally owned and operated hospital network expanded again to meet the needs of the volunteer and draftee population. ", "In the past two decades, the VA has purposely transitioned to leasing medical properties rather than building expensive new facilities that can take years to complete and often experience budget overruns. ", "As the nature of health care has evolved with a growth in same-day surgical procedures and outpatient care, so has the VA, and in 2018 Congress added access to private-sector urgent care outlets as one of the VA\u2019s health care benefits. ", "Today, the VA operates 172 inpatient VA Medical Centers (VAMCs), which are an average of 60 years old, and 1,113 Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), which are newer facilities designed to meet the needs of veterans closer to home. ", "The VA also manages a Community Care Network (CCN) through contracts with Optum and TriWest, third-party health care administrators responsible for building and maintaining a robust population of community providers to meet the needs of veterans referred for care outside of the VA system.

", "In 1986, David Stockman, who served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, wrote that: ", "Export subsidies are a mercantilist illusion, based on the illogical proposition that a nation can raise its employment and GNP by giving away its goods for less than what it costs to make them.\u2026 ", "Export subsidies subtract from GNP and jobs, not expand them\u2026. ", "Moreover, in 1981, the EXIM\u2019s practice was to bestow about two thirds of its subsidies on a handful of giant manufacturers, including Boeing aircraft, General Electric, and Westinghouse.", "1 ", "Since then, very little has changed.

", "The Bank should be abolished. ", "BACKGROUND\nThe Export\u2013Import Bank was created in 1934 as an export credit agency (ECA) to finance trade with the Soviet Union. ", "It was reorganized as an independent government agency in 1945.

", "Importantly, for four years starting at the end of 2015, the Bank became incapacitated. ", "Lacking a quorum for its board of directors, it could not extend financing that exceeded $10 million per project. That put an end to about 85 percent of the Bank\u2019s financing obligations.

", "During this same period, the Bank\u2019s total exposure increased from $57.42 billion in FY 2007", "6 to $112.1 billion in FY 2014", "7 and then fell to $41.3 billion in FY 2021", "8 and $35.4 billion in FY 2022.", "9 ", "CLAIMS VS.

", "Traditionally,\none of EXIM\u2019s top 10 domestic beneficiaries is Boeing, which at a 40 percent share of total loan authorizations dwarfs the 25 percent share for all small businesses that received EXIM\u2019s services combined.", "10 ", "On the foreign side, things are not much different: ", "The subsidized financing largely benefits very large companies like Mexico\u2019s Pemex, Ireland\u2019s Ryanair, and Emirates Airlines that either collect massive subsidies as state-controlled entities or could easily access private financing.", "11 ", "American businesses that lack political connections are put at a competitive disadvantage by their own government because they are forced to compete against both domestic and foreign businesses that enjoy access to subsidized loans.", "12 The Bank does not maintain or create jobs. ", "EXIM\u2019s supporters point to the\nnumbers of new jobs that they claim have been created through federal spending, but the unseen effects are ignored. For example, funding for one industry or firm might take more jobs away from other industries and firms, resulting in a net job loss even though jobs are created for the financed firm. ", "At best, it could be said that the Bank redistributes employment from unsubsidized firms to subsidized firms. ", "However, with very rare exceptions, most exports financed by EXIM would have taken place without government support. ", "Many companies have said so themselves;", "13 the procurement happens before the decision to get government support; and, as noted above, most EXIM deals go to large companies with easy access to capital. ", "Thus, the agency is taking credit for jobs that would have existed in any event. ", "The Bank does not promote exports. ", "EXIM presidents commonly claim\nthat the agency\u2019s mission is to support U.S. jobs by facilitating American exports through its export-financing tools. ", "However, trade economists have long known that export credit subsidies merely redistribute exporting opportunities to subsidized firms instead of increasing the net number of exports\u2014something that also slows economic growth.", "14 ", "Even more telling is the performance of the U.S. economy and American exports during the four years when EXIM lacked a board quorum (2015\u20132019) and was barred from finalizing deals in excess of $10 million. ", "During that time, EXIM authorizations fell from $21 billion in FY 2014 to $3.6 billion in FY 2018 (adjusted for inflation).", "15 However, also during that time, regular big-ticket EXIM beneficiaries continued to benefit from their easy access to capital markets and still had the ability to finance their export activities. ", "Further, U.S. exports were utterly unaffected by the reductions in the Bank\u2019s activities.", "16 U.S. unemployment fell to a level not seen in half a century, but exports soared with financing provided by commercial lenders. ", "The only negative economic impact from EXIM\u2019s lack of a board quorum was its effect on the Bank itself. ", "This contradicts EXIM\u2019s claim that its activities are crucial for the success of U.S. exporters and economic growth.

", "Subsidy-boosted exports do not boost economic growth. ", "EXIM\u2019s primary\nreason for existing is to increase exports, as if more exports themselves represent more jobs and economic growth. ", "Recent expressions of this fallacious belief can be found in a book by former EXIM President Fred Hochberg. ", "According to Hochberg, \u201cWe know that trade, and exports in particular, can have a big impact on jobs.\u201d", "17 ", "While this is a common misconception about exports, it is one worth correcting. ", "As trade economists know, exports are a cost to the economy: ", "They subtract from GDP. ", "Imports, on the other hand, add to GDP. ", "If the U.S. could acquire all of the imports that it currently gets without exporting anything in exchange, that would be the best of all worlds. ", "Unfortunately, one reason that foreigners are so eager to sell us their goods is that they want our dollars to buy our debt, invest in the country, and buy our exports. ", "That is why exports drop when overall imports drop. ", "Exports promote U.S. economic growth only if the value of the resources used to produce them is less than the value of what we receive as imports in exchange for those exports. ", "By subsidizing American exports, EXIM causes too many resources to be devoted to producing exports. ", "As a result, the total value of our exports is made larger than it would otherwise be to obtain any given amount of imports. ", "In other words, EXIM thus compels American taxpayers to subsidize foreigners\u2019 standards of living at no appreciable benefit to the U.S. ", "Unfortunately, this misunderstanding and the constant glamorization of exports and their impact on jobs and growth are used to justify government support for some exports (on average, 98 percent of exports are not backed by EXIM financing). ", "It also is extremely unfair. ", "Because capital will tend to shift from unsubsidized companies to subsidized companies (taxpayers foot the bill if companies backed by the Bank default), unsubsidized export companies face higher borrowing costs, which could translate into fewer jobs in unsubsidized companies or lower pay for their workers. ", "The Bank does not promote growth by leveling the playing field. ", "EXIM\u2019s\ncharter stipulates that one of its missions is to support U.S. exports with the goal of creating jobs and promoting economic growth through the provision of export financing via its loan-guarantee and insurance programs. ", "In particular, EXIM is to intervene in cases \u201cwhere such support is necessary to level the competitive playing field for U.S. exporters due to financing provided by foreign governments to their exporters.\u201d18 ", "As a result, EXIM for years has been focused primarily on what other countries\u2019 ECAs are doing and how much financing they are providing.", "19 ", "A reading of any of EXIM\u2019s Competitiveness Reports shows that the Bank frames the \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d of the U.S. economy and exporters in extremely narrow terms\u2014specifically, as the amount of business that foreign ECAs are doing relative to EXIM. ", "The report for 2020 features striking evidence of this mindset. ", "For instance, lamenting the \u201cnearly four-year hiatus\u201d during which the Bank lacked a board quorum to approve large deals, EXIM\u2019s leadership maintains that these years \u201cseverely hindered EXIM\u2019s ability to support the competitiveness of U.S. exporters.\u201d ", "During that time, foreign ECAs \u201cfundamentally evolved their philosophy and substantively expanded their roles,\u201d and \u201cthe United States must work hard to keep pace.\u201d ", "The Bank goes on to promise that it will \u201cre-emerge from the years of being out of the long-term export finance business and restore its standing as one of the world\u2019s most competitive ECAs.\u201d", "20 ", "In other words, EXIM bureaucrats appear to believe that economic growth and jobs result not from a favorable tax and regulatory environment, but from a victory in hand-to-hand subsidy combat between government banks.

", "Germany was the second-highest ranked OECD country on this list in 2019.

", "These data provide little support for the argument that Germany\u2019s strong economic performance has much, if anything, to do with the German ECA. ", "China by all accounts had a hyperactive ECA: ", "It ranked first on the list in 2019. ", "ECA-backed exports in China represented 2.1 percent of exports backed by government financing. ", "Whatever one perceives as China\u2019s economic successes, it is hard to argue that the main driver of China\u2019s exports is its ECA. ", "The report highlights the eighth-ranked U.S. for its unusually low level of EXIM-backed exports. ", "At the time of the report, the U.S. economy was thriving, wages and employment were up, and the country still had flourishing trade\u2014but it was also striving when EXIM was mostly dormant. ", "In other words, one cannot argue that the bustling economy was the result of EXIM support. ", "Even in countries touted as leaders in relying on ECA financing, ECA-backed exports are never more than 4.7 percent of total exports. ", "Moreover, even that is an outlier. ", "For 23 of the 28 countries on this list (including both China and the U.S.), the share of exports backed by ECA financing is less than 2 percent. ", "This fact suggests that\u2014contrary to the claims of EXIM\u2019s advocates\u2014ECA financing is irrelevant to the overall health of the export market as well as to economic growth.

", "In addition, there is no evidence that EXIM has altered its intense focus on competing with other governments\u2019 ECAs. ", "If the Bank were serious about competing against China, it would be targeting the low-income markets where China has been making its most important investments. ", "Instead, its obsession with other ECAs has caused EXIM to direct the vast majority of its funding to large foreign companies in higher-income nations. ", "Data available on the OECD website show that the level of ECA financing in high-income countries in 2019 was more than double the amount in low-income countries.", "29 ", "The same was true for previous years.

", "One concern raised against commodity backing is that there is not enough gold in the federal government for all the dollars in existence.

", "Also, in reality, a very small number of users trade for gold as long as they believe the government will stick to the price peg. ", "The mere fact that people could exchange dollars for gold is what acts as the enforcer. ", "After all, if one is confident that a dollar will still be worth 1/2000 ounce of gold in a year, it is much easier to walk about with paper dollars and use credit cards than it is to mail tiny $80 coins. ", "People would redeem en masse only if they feared the government would not be able control itself, for which the only solution is for the government to control itself. ", "Beyond full backing, alternate paths to gold backing might involve gold-convertible Treasury instruments29 or allowing a parallel gold standard to operate temporarily alongside the current fiat dollar.30 These could ease adoption while minimizing disruption, but they should be temporary so that we can quickly enjoy the benefits of gold\u2019s ability to police government spending. ", "In addition, Congress could simply allow individuals to use commodity-backed money without fully replacing the current system.

", "NGDP targeting stabilizes total nominal spending directly. ", "The Taylor Rule does so indirectly, operating through the federal funds rate. ", "NGDP targeting keeps total nominal spending growth on a steady path. ", "If the demand for money (liquidity) rises, the Fed meets it by increasing the money supply; if the demand for money falls, the Fed responds by reducing the money supply. ", "This minimizes the effects of demand shocks on the economy. ", "For example, if the long-run growth rate of the U.S. economy is 3 percent and the Fed has a 5 percent NGDP growth target, it expands the money supply enough to boost nominal income by 5 percent each year, which translates into 3 percent real growth and 2 percent inflation. ", "How much money must be created each year depends on how fast money demand is growing. ", "The Taylor Rule works similarly. ", "It says the Fed should raise its policy rate when inflation and real output growth are above trend and lower its policy rate when inflation and real output growth are below trend. ", "Whereas NGDP targeting focuses directly on stable demand as an outcome, the Taylor Rule focuses on the Fed\u2019s more reliable policy levers. ", "The problem with both rules is the knowledge burden they place on central bankers. ", "These rules state that the Fed should neutralize demand shocks but not respond to supply shocks, which means that it should \u201csee through\u201d demand shocks by tolerating higher (or lower) inflation. ", "In theory, this has much to recommend it. ", "In practice, it can be very difficult to distinguish between demand-side destabilization and supply-side destabilization in real time. ", "There also are political considerations: ", "Fed officials may not be willing to curb unjustified economic booms and all too willing to suppress necessary economic restructuring following a bust. ", "Either rule likely outperforms a strict inflation target and greatly outperforms the Fed\u2019s current pseudo-inflation target. ", "While NGDP targeting and the Taylor Rule have much to commend them, they might be harder to explain and justify to the public. ", "Inflation targeting has an intelligibility advantage: ", "Voters know what it means to stabilize the dollar\u2019s purchasing power. ", "Capable elected officials must persuade the public that the advantages of NGDP targeting and the Taylor Rule, especially in terms of supporting labor markets, outweigh the disadvantages. ", "MINIMUM EFFECTIVE REFORMS\n", "Because Washington operates on two-year election cycles, any monetary reform must take account of disruption to financial markets and the economy at large.

", "To conclude this analysis, it is\nuseful to offer brief reflections on a number of key obstacles to implementing the policy initiatives recommended in this chapter. ", "These obstacles include: ", "The dogma of the Ricardian free-trade model, which has been used as propaganda to thwart the adoption of measures that seek to level the global trading field for American manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and workers; ", "The politics of trade policy, which has led to a great divide that makes trade policy reforms difficult to implement; ", "The economics of trade deficits, which are not adequately understood either by the American public or by the policymaking intelligentsia; and ", "The crucial role of supportive White House and Administration personnel in implementing effective trade policies. ", "The Dogma of Free Trade. ", "Clearly, the fair and balanced trade orientation\nof this chapter runs starkly against the free trade grain of the globalist Ricardian orthodoxy, which is predicated on the theory that free trade represents the best path by which to achieve both American and global prosperity. ", "This orthodoxy is based on the ivory tower academic conclusion that if countries trade freely among each other, each will pursue its own comparative advantages; production will be most efficient around the world; the economic pie will be bigger both for the globe and for each free trading country; and (so long as workers who lose their jobs are fairly compensated from the gains from trade) everyone will be better off. ", "The most obvious problem with this orthodoxy (there are many more) is that nowhere is Ricardian free trade mirrored in the real world. ", "Instead, America trades in a world where the WTO\u2019s MFN rules are stacked against us, scofflaws like Communist China run roughshod over what meager WTO rules there are, and the United States among all of the world\u2019s developed nations is the biggest victim of the free trade Ricardian orthodoxy. ", "During his first term, President Donald Trump preached that there can be no free trade without fair, reciprocal, and balanced trade. ", "He was right then, and whoever is the next President in 2025 should heed this critical principle whenever the flag of free trade is waved to prevent the adoption of needed reforms. ", "The Politics of Trade Policy: ", "Who Benefits? ", "Today, there is a great divide\namong Americans that stands in the way of constructive trade policy reforms. ", "This great divide is certainly not about a partisan desire for low taxes and a reduced regulatory burden. ", "Rather, it is over whether our borders should be open or secure and whether it is prudent to offshore our manufacturing and defense industrial base and associated supply chains. ", "Those who support secure borders and seek to onshore more of American production and supply chains do so to boost the real wages of American workers and to enhance our national security. ", "Some Americans historically have supported open borders and offshoring under the flag of the Ricardian trade model, which assumes the free flow of both labor and capital. ", "Yet it is equally true that open borders and offshoring also help American multinational corporations to maximize their profits by minimizing their labor and environmental protection costs. ", "In particular, an open border policy, which allows for the unlimited migration of cheap labor, depresses American wage rates and thereby boosts corporate profits. ", "At the same time, offshoring gives American corporations readier access to the sweatshops and pollution havens of Asia and Latin America. ", "Our skies and water may be cleaner, and our products may be cheaper, Main Street manufacturers and workers bear the brunt of these policies. ", "The obvious political problem in adopting many of the policies proposed here is that they will be opposed by the special-interest groups that benefit from open borders and offshoring and that contribute lavishly to both political parties. ", "These special-interest groups range from the hedge funds of Wall Street and tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley to big-box retailers that stuff their aisles particularly with cheap \u201cMade in China\u201d goods. ", "YES, TRADE DEFICITS MATTER\n[O]", "ur country has been behaving like an extraordinarily rich family that possesses an immense farm. ", "In order to consume 4% more than we produce\u2014 that\u2019s the trade deficit\u2014we have, day by day, been both selling pieces of the farm and increasing the mortgage on what we still own. ", "Warren Buffett37 ", "Historically, one line of attack against attempts to implement fair trade policies in the name of reducing America\u2019s massive and chronic trade deficit has been the claim that \u201ctrade deficits don\u2019t matter.\u201d ", "The intellectual tip of this spear has often been think tanks that generate reams of analyses in support of a purely free trade (and open borders) American posture.", "38 ", "Yet both common sense and several very good reasons tell us that trade deficits matter a great deal. ", "Economic Security. ", "The economic security argument that trade deficits matter\nbegins with the observation that growth in any country\u2019s real, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) depends on only four factors: consumption, government spending, business investment, and net exports (the difference between exports and imports). ", "Reducing a trade deficit through implementation of the U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act, the application of tariffs, or renegotiating a bad trade deal like NAFTA all represent ways to increase net exports\u2014and thereby boost the rate of economic growth. ", "Suppose, for example, that under the USRTA the American President persuaded India to reduce its very high protectionist tariffs and Japan to lower its formidable nontariff barriers. ", "America would surely sell more Florida oranges, Washington apples, California wine, Wisconsin cheese, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. ", "The resultant fall in the trade deficit would increase America\u2019s GDP, and the real wages of blue-collar America would rise from Seattle and Orlando to Sonoma and Milwaukee. ", "But that\u2019s not all. ", "Consider, too, the investment term in the GDP growth equation. ", "When U.S. companies offshore their production to chase cheap labor or manufacture in a \u201cpollution haven\u201d country like Communist China or India with lax environmental regulations, the result is reduced nonresidential fixed investment\u2014and a GDP growth rate that is lower than it would be otherwise. ", "Moreover, if such offshored production results in more foreign exports to the U.S.\u2014for example, an American consumer buys a Made in Mexico Dodge Journey or Chevrolet Trax rather than a vehicle assembled in Detroit\u2014the trade deficit rises along with the fall in investment, further reducing GDP growth. ", "National Security. ", "The national security argument that trade deficits matter\nbegins with America\u2019s national-income accounting double-entry system and this accounting identity: ", "Any deficit in the current account caused by imbalanced trade must be offset by a surplus in the capital account, meaning foreign invest ment in the U.S. ", "In the short term, this balance-of-payments equilibrium may indeed \u201cnot matter\u201d as foreigners return our trade-deficit dollars to American shores by seemingly benignly investing in U.S. government bonds and stocks. ", "Of course, this infusion of foreign capital lowers American mortgage rates and keeps the stock market bullishly capitalized, which appears to be all to the good. ", "Over time, however, running large and persistent trade deficits leads to a massive transfer of American wealth offshore into foreign hands. ", "This wealth transfer happens as foreigners use their export dollars to buy American real estate, companies, and financial assets like the aforementioned stocks and government bonds. ", "The American investor Warren Buffett has referred to such wealth transfers offshore as \u201cconquest by purchase.\u201d ", "To Buffett, the big danger is that foreigners will eventually own so many U.S. government bonds that Americans will wind up working longer hours just to survive and service that foreign debt. ", "There is an even bigger national security danger, however, that Mr. Buffett has missed: an alternative conquest-by-purchase scenario. ", "Suppose, for example, that one of the biggest holders of U.S. dollars is a rapidly militarizing strategic rival like Communist China that is intent on world hegemony. ", "By buying up America\u2019s companies, technologies, farmland, food producers, and key elements of the domestic supply chain, Communist China can thereby gain more and more control of the U.S. manufacturing and defense-industrial base. ", "In this scenario, might America thereby lose a broader war for America\u2019s freedom and prosperity, not by shots fired but by American cash registers ringing up \u201cMade in China\u201d products? ", "Might America even lose a broader hot war because it sent its defense industrial base abroad on the wings of a persistent trade deficit? ", "It follows that for both economic and national security reasons, trade deficits do indeed matter. ", "It is therefore of critical importance that we bring America\u2019s global trade back into balance through free, fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade and that we do so through the kind of policy initiatives and reforms recommended in this chapter. ", "PERSONNEL IS TRADE POLICY\n", "Having a clear set of trade and industrial policies to achieve one\u2019s economic and national security goals, while essential, is not enough. ", "The lessons of the Nixon, Reagan, and Trump Administrations teach us that \u201cpersonnel is policy\u201d or, in this case, that \u201cbad personnel will mean bad trade policy.\u201d", "39 ", "That is why it will be equally critical to the next President\u2019s trade policy agenda to have key personnel in place who not only have the skills to implement the policies, but also have the firm commitment to do so. ", "During the Trump Administration, President Trump\u2019s key policy advisers and Cabinet officials clashed on the issues of international trade and combating Communist China\u2019s economic aggression. ", "As much as President Trump did on the trade front that was bold and innovative and as much as he achieved by challenging Communist China, too much of his trade policy was disrupted or derailed by key personnel who did not share the President\u2019s vision of fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade. ", "In thinking about the personnel positions that are most essential to effective implementation of trade policy, the most obvious position to get exactly right is that of the United States Trade Representative. ", "The USTR is at least putatively the top official on trade policy, and it is critical that this position be filled wisely. ", "Historically, during Republican Administrations, the USTR has been a free trader who rarely challenged the protectionist and mercantilist policies of America\u2019s trading partners and typically would seek to expand global trade. ", "The Trump Administration broke this globalist Republican tradition by appointing as USTR attorney Robert E. Lighthizer, who not only had a keen understanding of the various legal levers a President can use to advance trade policy, but also was committed to the President\u2019s fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade agenda. ", "The next Administration should make every effort to find someone with that understanding and that commitment to fill this position. ", "Less obvious\u2014but almost as important\u2014is the need to fill the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade wisely. ", "One of the most important functions of the International Trade Administration, which is an agency in the Department of Commerce, is to impose antidumping and countervailing duties against trade cheaters who dump products below cost into American markets or unfairly subsidize their exports. ", "In fact, much of the cheating that does take place in the global trading arena can be addressed through such antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) cases. ", "Within the West Wing itself, it is equally critical that the National Security Adviser, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), and the Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) all be aligned on trade policy. ", "During the Trump Administration, with the notable exception of the President\u2019s third National Security Adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, and third CEA Chairman, Tyler Goodspeed, this regrettably was not the case. ", "Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, the Secretary of Defense plays a key role in trade policy, at least when it comes to advancing Section 232 cases. ", "Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,40 the President has the authority, through tariffs or other means, to reduce imports from other countries \u201cif the President determines that such reduction or elimination would threaten to impair the national security.\u201d ", "As a practical matter, the Secretary of Commerce spearheads any Section 232 cases, but in order to proceed with a Section 232 case, Commerce must obtain signoff from the Secretary of Defense. ", "When President Trump wanted to implement steel and aluminum tariffs, he had a willing servant in Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. ", "However, Secretary of Defense James Mattis resisted. ", "Mattis simply did not understand a key tenet of the Trump Administration: ", "Economic security is also national security. ", "Without vibrant steel and aluminum industries, it will be difficult for America to provide the Pentagon with the kind of weapons it needs to defend the homeland. ", "CONCLUSION\nA Harvard professor once told me during my doctoral thesis days that \u201cif I tell you how it is, I\u2019ve told you why it can\u2019t change.\u201d ", "Despite the obvious exploitation of American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers by the international trading system and Communist Chinese aggression, powerful political forces nonetheless exist that profit from the status quo. ", "The stark lesson of this chapter is that America gets fleeced every day in the global marketplace both by a predatory Communist China and by an institutionally unfair and nonreciprocal WTO. ", "Addressing these two challenges would go a long way toward restoring American greatness, both economically and militarily. ", "Ignoring these two challenges will simply continue the parasitic draining of the American manufacturing and defense industrial base.

", "Trade-unrelated provisions are routinely hijacked by progressives and rent-seekers and dilute otherwise worthwhile trade agreements. ", "They also create additional points of contention that make agreements unnecessarily difficult to pass. ", "A conservative trade policy should limit trade-unrelated provisions in trade agreements. ", "This does not mean that conservatives should ignore international negotiations on labor, environment, intellectual property, and other non-trade issues. ", "It means they are more likely to succeed by treating each of them separately rather than letting them die in committee with each providing an additional sticking point for delaying the others. ", "A conservative trade policy must also take seriously the reality that in a democracy, the other side holds power about half of the time, but progressives run most agencies almost all of the time.

", "Accordingly, life expectancy was around 40 years, and literacy was 13 percent.", "42 ", "Today, fewer than 1 percent of Americans work on farms, yet America is a net exporter of food. ", "People have infinite wants, so as rising productivity pushed some people off of farms, there were countless other jobs they could do. ", "In true American fashion, many of these jobs were in brand new industries. ", "This was possible because the same can-do cultural values that inspired the American founding were accurately reflected in its new government. ", "The U.S. Constitution created what was then the world\u2019s largest free trade area, and it did so on purpose.", "43 ", "The combination of the American self-improvement ethos and the large, free internal market guaranteed by the Constitution yielded intensive growth on a scale never before seen. ", "Many displaced farm laborers got jobs making the very farm equipment that made intensive agricultural growth possible, from railroad networks to cotton gins. ", "Each fed the other. ", "Agriculture and industry are not separate; they are as interconnected as everything else in the economy. ", "None of this could have happened had the government enacted policies to preserve full agricultural employment. ", "Understanding Value. ", "Just as communication is impossible without agreedupon definitions of words, coherent policymaking is impossible without coherent\ncategories.

", "The factory worker who builds a tractor does as much to boost farm production as the farmers themselves, yet economic planners put them in different categories. ", "This problem is baked into industrial policy, as progressive planners have learned again and again.

", "As a result, before the formula shortage in 2022, approximately 98 percent of the country\u2019s baby formula was produced domestically. ", "With foreign competition out of the way, other government policies helped to concentrate almost the entire domestic formula industry into four firms. ", "Roughly 40 percent of baby formula purchases are made by state-level food assistance programs, which typically do not let families choose their own formula brands. ", "Instead they must buy from a single producer, which guarantees producers large market shares in states where they win contracts.

", "By resigning, the exiting Commissioner enables the President to nominate someone from his own political party to the FCC, and this typically shifts the political balance on the FCC toward the President\u2019s political party. ", "The President generally designates one of the existing Commissioners of the President\u2019s same political party as Chairperson\u2014either on an acting or a permanent basis\u2014on or shortly after Inauguration Day. ", "Under a tradition that dates back a few decades, when a relevant vacancy arises, the President allows the leader of the opposite political party in the Senate to select the person who will serve in the minority Commissioner role. ", "The President then formally nominates the person identified by Senate leadership. This also is not required by law. ", "As specified in the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC\u2019s Chairperson serves as the agency\u2019s CEO and is empowered with significant authority that is not shared with other Commissioners.", "6 For instance, the Chairperson sets the FCC\u2019s agenda, decides what matters the agency will vote on and when, and has authority to organize and coordinate the FCC\u2019s work.", "7 There is no separate Senate confirmation process for the position of FCC Chairperson; the President designates one of the Commissioners to serve as Chairperson through a short one-sentence or two-sentence letter.", "8 There are no limits on the number of terms that a person can serve as an FCC Commissioner, though Commissioners need to be nominated and con firmed for each five-year term.

", "Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop.

", "They are not simply prevailing in the free market; they are taking advantage of a landscape that has been skewed\u2014in many cases by the government\u2014to favor their business models over those of their competitors. ", "It is hard to imagine another industry in which a greater gap exists between power and accountability. ", "That is why a new Administration should support FCC action on several fronts. ", "Specifically, the FFC should: ", "Eliminate immunities that courts added to Section 230. ", "The FCC\nshould issue an order that interprets Section 230 in a way that eliminates the expansive, non-textual immunities that courts have read into the statute.

", "As Justice Clarence Thomas has made clear, courts have construed Section 230 broadly to confer on some of the world\u2019s largest companies a sweeping immunity that is found nowhere in the text of the statute.", "18 They have done so in a way that nullifies the limits Congress placed on the types of actions that Internet companies can take while continuing to benefit from Section 230. ", "One way to start correcting this error is for the FCC to remind courts how the various portions of Section 230 operate. ", "At the outset, the FCC can clarify that Section 230(c)(1) does not apply broadly to every decision that a platform makes. ", "Rather, its protections apply only when a platform does not remove information provided by someone else. ", "In contrast, the FCC should clarify that the more limited Section 230(c)(2) protections apply to any covered platform\u2019s decision to restrict access to material provided by someone else. ", "Combined, these actions will appropriately limit the number of cases in which a platform can censor with the benefit of Section 230\u2019s protections. ", "Such clarifications might also include drawing out the traditional legal distinction between distributor and publisher liability; ", "Section 230 did not do away with the former, nor does it collapse into the latter. ", "Impose transparency rules on Big Tech. ", "Today, Big Tech offers a black\nbox. ", "After Google manipulates search results, a small business can see its web traffic drop precipitously overnight for no apparent reason, potentially flipping its outlook from black to red. ", "On Facebook, social media posts are left up or taken down, accounts suspended or permanently banned, without any apparent consistency. ", "Out of the blue, YouTube can demonetize individuals who have risked their capital and invested their labor to build online businesses. ", "At present, the FCC requires broadband providers to comply with a transparency rule that can provide a good baseline for Big Tech. ", "Under the FCC\u2019s rule, broadband providers must provide detailed disclosures about practices that would shape Internet traffic\u2014from blocking to prioritizing or discriminating against content. ", "The FCC could take a similar approach to Big Tech, and it should look to Section 230 and the Consolidated Reporting Act as potential sources of authority.", "19 ", "In acting, the FCC could require these platforms to provide greater specificity regarding their terms of service, and it could hold them accountable by prohibiting actions that are inconsistent with those plain and particular terms. ", "Within this framework, Big Tech should be required to offer a transparent appeals process that allows for the challenging of pretextual takedowns or other actions that violate clear rules of the road. ", "Support legislation that scraps Section 230\u2019s current approach. ", "The\nFCC should work with Congress on more fundamental Section 230 reforms that go beyond interpreting its current terms. ", "Congress should do so by ensuring that Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections. ", "As part of those reforms, the FCC should work with Congress to ensure that antidiscrimination provisions are applied to Big Tech\u2014including \u201cback-end\u201d companies that provide hosting services and DDoS protection. ", "Reforms that prohibit discrimination against core political viewpoints are one way to do this and would track the approach taken in a social media law passed in Texas, which was upheld on appeal in late 2022 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.", "20 ", "In all of this, Congress can make certain points clear. ", "It could focus legislation on dominant, general-use platforms rather than specialized ones. ", "This could include excluding comment sections in online publications, specialized message boards, or communities within larger platforms that self-moderate. ", "Similarly, Congress could legislate in a way that does not require any platform to host illegal content; child pornography; terrorist speech; and indecent, profane, or similar categories of speech that Congress has previously carved out. ", "Support efforts to empower consumers. ", "The FCC and Congress should\nwork together to formulate rules that empower consumers. ", "Section 230 itself codifies \u201cuser control\u201d as an express policy goal and encourages Internet platforms to provide tools that will \u201cempower\u201d users to engage in their own content moderation. ", "As Congress takes up reforms, it should therefore be mindful of how we can return to Internet users the power to control their online experiences. ", "One idea is to empower consumers to choose their own content filters and fact checkers, if any. ", "The FCC should also work with Congress to ensure stronger protections against young children accessing social media sites despite age restrictions that generally prohibit their use of these sites. ", "It should be noted at this point that the views expressed here are not shared uniformly by all conservatives. ", "There are some, including contributors to this chapter, who do not think that the FCC or Congress should act in a way that regulates the content-moderation decisions of private platforms. ", "One of the main arguments that this group offers is that doing so would intrude\u2014 unlawfully in their view\u2014on the First Amendment rights of corporations to exclude content from their private platforms. ", "Require that Big Tech begin to contribute a fair share. ", "Big Tech\nhas avoided accountability in several additional ways as well. ", "One of them concerns the FCC\u2019s roughly $9 billion Universal Service Fund. ", "This initiative provides the support necessary to subsidize the agency\u2019s affordable Internet and rural connectivity programs. ", "The FCC obtains this funding through a line-item charge that carriers add to consumers\u2019 monthly bills for traditional telecommunications service. ", "While Big Tech derives tremendous value from the federal government\u2019s universal service investments\u2014using those federally supported networks to deliver their products and realize significant profits\u2014these large corporations have avoided paying a fair share into the program. ", "On top of that, the FCC\u2019s current funding mechanism has been on an unsustainable path.", "21 ", "By requiring traditional telephone customers to contribute to a fund that is being used increasingly to support broadband networks, the FCC\u2019s current approach is the regulatory equivalent of taxing horseshoes to pay for highways. ", "To put the FCC\u2019s universal service program on a stable footing, Congress should require Big Tech companies to start contributing an appropriate amount. ", "Conservatives are not unanimous in agreeing that the FCC should expand the USF contribution base. ", "Instead, some argue that Congress should revisit the program\u2019s entire funding structure and determine whether to continue subsidizing the provision of service. ", "Future funding decisions, the argument goes, should be made by Congress through the normal appropriation process through which the USF program can compete for funding with other national initiatives. ", "These decisions should be made with an eye to right-sizing the federal government\u2019s existing broadband initiatives in light of both technological advances and the recent influx of billions of dollars in new appropriations that can be used to support efforts to end the digital divide. ", "Protecting America\u2019s National Security. ", "During the Trump Administration, the FCC ushered in a new and appropriately strong approach to the national\nsecurity threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). ", "During that time, the FCC eliminated federal subsidies for telecommunications equipment from Huawei and ZTE, thereby greatly reducing the chances of that equipment finding a way into our nation\u2019s communications networks. ", "The FCC also stood up a program to rip and replace insecure network gear to ensure that it did not remain a threat lurking inside our systems. ", "The FCC revoked or denied the licenses of carriers like China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom, which presented unacceptable national security risks. ", "There are, however, additional strong actions that the FCC can and should take to address the CCP\u2019s malign campaign. ", "Specifically: ", "Address TikTok\u2019s threat to U.S. national security. ", "As law enforcement\nofficials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America\u2019s national security.", "22 ", "It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans. ", "As of this writing, the Biden Administration\u2019s Treasury Department has not announced a final decision concerning its long-pending review of TikTok. ", "If that inaction persists, or if the Administration allows TikTok to continue to operate in the U.S., a new Administration should ban the application on national security grounds.

", "Without FCC approval, new Huawei gear cannot be lawfully sold or used in the U.S. ", "However, the FCC must do a better job of ensuring that its Covered List stays up to date and accounts for changes in corporate names and forms.

", "The FEC has no authority over the administration of federal elections, which is performed by state governments. ", "While the FEC has exclusive civil enforcement authority over FECA,2 the U.S. Justice Department has criminal enforcement authority, which is defined as a knowing and willful violation of the law.", "3 Because the FEC is an independent agency and not a division or office directly within the executive branch, the authority of the President over the actions of the FEC is extremely limited. ", "As former FEC Commissioner Bradley Smith has said, the FEC\u2019s \u201c[r]egulation of campaign finance deeply implicates First Amendment principles of free speech and association.\u201d", "4 ", "The FEC regulates in one of the most sensitive areas of the Bill of Rights: political speech and political activity by citizens, candidates, political parties, and the voluntary membership organizations that represent Americans who share common views on a huge range of important and vital public policy issues.

Under FECA, no more than three commissioners may be from the same party.", "6 While that means that a commissioner could be an independent or a member of the Libertarian or Green Parties, in practice, this has meant that the FEC has always had three Democrat and three Republican commissioners.", "7 There is a long-held political tradition since the FEC\u2019s founding that when a commission slot held by a member of the opposition political party opens up, the President consults with, and nominates, the chosen nominee of the opposition party\u2019s leader in the Senate. In exchange, the Senate party leader and his caucus agree to approve the President\u2019s nominee to fill an empty position for the President\u2019s political party. It has also been customary to advance the two nominees of the differing political parties at the same time; this bipartisan pairing has historically permitted easy confirmation of both parties\u2019 selectees. ", "Thus, by convention, a Republican President will nominate a Republican and a Democrat for two open commission slots, including the choice of the Democrat Senate leader for his party\u2019s seat. ", "In turn, the senator will direct his party to vote to confirm both nominees. ", "In the almost 50-year history of the FEC, this tradition has only been broken once\u2014when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid refused to approve one of George W.

", "Accordingly, the final votes of the commissioners did not approve moving forward with enforcement because there were not four affirmative votes that a violation of the law occurred.

", "The President should prioritize nominations to the FEC once\ncommissioners reach the end of their terms and should be assisted\nby legislative language either eliminating or limiting overstays to\na reasonable period of time to permit the vetting, nomination, and\nconfirmation of successors.\n", "The President should vigorously oppose all efforts, as proposed,\nfor example, in Section 6002 of the \u201cFor the People Act of 2021,\u201d14\nto change the structure of the FEC to reduce the number of\ncommissioners from six to five or another odd number. ", "The current\nrequirement of four votes to authorize an enforcement action, provide an advisory opinion, or issue regulations, ensures that there is bipartisan agreement before any action is taken and protects against the FEC being used as a political weapon. ", "With only five commissioners, three members of the same political party could control the enforcement process of the agency, raising the potential of a powerful federal agency enforcing the law on a partisan basis against the members of the opposition political party. ", "Efforts to impose a \u201cnonpartisan\u201d or so-called \u201cindependent\u201d chair are impractical; the chair will inevitably be aligned with his or her appointing party, at least as a matter of perception.

", "But, until there is a return to a constitutional structure that the Founding Fathers would have recognized and a massive shrinking of the administrative state, conservatives cannot unilaterally disarm and fail to use the power of government to further a conservative agenda.

", "Khan responded by saying that she turned down deals when firms offered social justice policies in return for approving unlawful deals. ", "In response to a similar question from Senator Tom Cotton, Khan responded that firms try to come to the FTC to get out of antitrust liability by offering climate, diversity, or other forms of ESG-type offerings, but that there is no ESG loophole in the antitrust laws.", "14 ", "Her comments suggest that there is a movement of firms attempting to use both ESG and DEI as a sort of reputational laundering to avoid enforcement of potentially criminal activity. ", "The FTC should set up an ESG/DEI collusion task force to investigate firms\u2014particularly in private equity\u2014to see if they are using the practice as a means to meet targets, fix prices, or reduce output.

", "While such decisions are often justified on public relations, marketing, or branding grounds\u2014and normally such decisions, reflecting business judgment, should and would receive deference, this presumption is harder to make in a highly partisan, ideologically divided America. ", "This type of behavior can rise to the level of an unfair trade practice when the business is (1) publicly traded; (2) highly regulated; (3) enjoys legal privileges; (4) enjoys market power; and (5) appears to engage in its own political or social agenda that is unrelated to any conceivable branding concerns. ", "The government, as guided by democratically passed laws, already regulates activities such as fossil fuel extraction and gun manufacturing. ", "Businesses, particularly those that enjoy certain government privileges or relationships and/ or market power, should not replace democratic decision-making with their own judgment on controversial matters. ", "A related concern is the degree to which concentration of industries, particularly in pharmaceuticals, health care, and the internet, encourages government collusion that undermines democratic institutions.

", "In addition, excessive social media use is strongly linked to mental health issues among individuals. ", "Several studies strongly support the notion that social media use is a cause, not just a correlation, of subjective well-being and poor mental health.", "19 ", "Social media and other large platforms form millions of contracts every year with American children. And even though a minor can void most contracts into which he or she enters, most jurisdictions have laws that hold minors accountable for the benefits received under the contract. Thus, children can make enforceable contracts for which parents could end up bearing responsibility. ", "Targeting children to create potentially harmful contracts or making parents responsible for such contractual relationships is an unfair trade practice. ", "The FTC, therefore, has the authority, interest, and duty to protect children online from such contractual relationships. ", "The FTC should examine platforms\u2019 advertising and contract-\nmaking with children as a deceptive or unfair trade practice, perhaps\nrequiring written parental consent.\n", "Currently, the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)20 regulates the information internet firms can obtain from children. ", "COPPA fails because it (1) only protects children under the age of 13, leaving older teenagers completely unprotected and (2) only prohibits platforms from collecting information from a child using \u201cactual knowledge\u201d rather than abiding by the \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d standard, which prohibits collecting information from a user reasonably assumed to be underage.

", "In addition, some of the methods used to regulate children\u2019s internet access pose the risk of unintended harms. ", "For instance, age verification regulations would inevitably increase the amount of data collection involved, increasing privacy concerns.

", "Such a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d approach would benefit the FTC enormously. ", "Practically, this would mean establishing a distinct role in the FTC Chairman\u2019s office focused on state AG cooperation and inviting state AGs to Washington, D.C., to discuss enforcement policy in key sectors under the FTC\u2019s jurisdiction: Big Tech, hospital mergers, supermarket mergers, and so forth. ", "FTC regional offices are substantially more in touch with local issues. ", "Over the past few decades, the reach and influence of regional offices has shrunk dramatically. ", "The FTC should consider returning authority to these offices. ", "Some conservatives however are less supportive of this idea. ", "Conservative enthusiasm for the idea of adding regional FTC offices to the states is a break from the majority conservative position. ", "Endorsing the federal government as a premier job creator runs counter to decades of conservative opinion that holds that New Deal agencies and subsequent government bodies should never have been created in the first place, and that their red tape and interference is a dominant cause of economic inefficiency.

", "Despite their enormous size, they have avoided significant antitrust liability or prosecution. ", "The reasons for this are not entirely clear. ", "It may be because these platforms have been incredibly innovative and have generated tremendous efficiencies for our society, with little to no evidence of traditional consumer harm in the form of higher prices, reduced output, or a lack of innovation. ", "Also, Americans report a high level of satisfaction in and trust regarding these companies. ", "The less friendly regulatory environment in the European Union would make a good case study in expansive antitrust law.

", "On the other hand, the platforms challenge traditional economic thinking because arguably the firm structure they employ is radically different, and they create different competition dynamics. ", "First, there is some evidence that the major internet platforms have market power, resulting in increased prices for advertisers, costs that very well could be passed onto consumers. ", "For instance, numerous government studies have found evidence of market power.", "23 ", "And while some data show declining advertising costs, they also show increasing prices in this decade.", "24 ", "Second, while consumers may report that they like social media, hedonics tells a different story, suggesting that social media and other online activities diminish human happiness.

", "For decades, antitrust economics has been focused on a paradigm in which firm and consumer behavior are modeled as functions of price and output as the primary variables. It may very well be that these models do not fully capture the effect of technologies that enable increasing returns to scale based on data, such as digital platforms. This possibility cannot be lightly discounted, considering the tremendous market power of these firms and their market cap, with the top five firms of the U.S. market (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet) responsible for 23.5 percent of the market cap of the S&P 500 index in early December 2021. ", "The questionable predictive power of traditional economic theory was illustrated when, after a much-heralded investigation, antitrust regulators appointed by former President Barack Obama declined to sue Google in January 2013 for anticompetitive behavior. ", "The FTC spent 19 months investigating Google over allegations that the search giant was violating antitrust laws by favoring its own products over those of rival content providers, including eBay, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Facebook, and Amazon. ", "The probe focused on Google\u2019s control over online search and search advertising, as well as the company\u2019s growing dominance in mobile phone software. ", "According to documents uncovered in press reports,27 the FTC\u2019s economists successfully argued against initiating antitrust action against the company. ", "This decision was based in large part on a series of predictions that the agency\u2019s staff economic experts made. ", "These predictions turned out to be wrong in several respects. ", "For instance, according to press accounts, these economic experts saw only \u201climited potential for growth\u201d in ads that track users across the web\u2014now the backbone of Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s $182.5 billion in annual revenue. ", "Relying on theory, the experts downplayed the importance of mobile search, believing that search would continue to be conducted primarily on desktop computers\u2014and thereby underestimating the effect of Google on Android systems. ", "The experts predicted that Microsoft, Mozilla, or Amazon would offer viable competition to Google in mobile search. ", "This decision, of course, occurred in a political environment of close relationships between the Obama Administration and Silicon Valley. ", "Just as traditional economic theory seems inadequate to the job of understanding Big Tech and predicting its behavior, empirical evidence is very difficult to come by. ", "This is particularly troublesome. ", "Beyond the fact that most user data are proprietary, online markets change so quickly that econometric conclusions are often difficult to make because even if the data are available, they do not exist for long enough time horizons. ", "Yet, a pattern of highly concentrated firms\u2014with occasional dropout and replacement by another successor firm with vast market power\u2014seems to be emerging. ", "The policy implications of this quandary are not clear, but for the conservative movement, some believe that some type of policy response is necessary. ", "The dominant internet platforms have disrupted democratic deliberation, as is evidenced by the Hunter Biden laptop story. ", "They have a propensity to collude with government to advance political goals, as documents unearthed by the Missouri and Louisiana AG suits concerning the COVID response demonstrate. ", "And they play a pivotal role in our economy. ", "As Judge Frank Easterbrook famously suggested, regulators should look at the cost of error in their judgments.

", "More broadly, the utility benefits of many online platforms and services are obscure and may be significantly overstated, as the most recent evidence suggests.", "29 ", "The FTC must become more sophisticated in measuring consumer surplus. In addition, the FTC should be open to behavioral explanations, such as habit and small hedonic differences, as keys to how platforms create and keep market power.", "30 ", "CONCLUSION\n", "Conservative approaches to antitrust and consumer protection continue to trust markets, not government, to give people what they want and provide the prosperity and material resources Americans need for flourishing, productive, and meaningful lives.

Feulner\n", "The idea of Mandate for Leadership was first conceived in the fall of 1979 at a Heritage Foundation board of trustees meeting when former Treasury Secretary Bill Simon and former General Services Administration Administrator Jack Eckerd discussed the predicament they had faced when they first joined a new, more conservative presidential Administration: ", "They received no practical plans on how to move their part of the federal bureaucracy to reflect a more conservative policy direction other than vague exhortations to promote free markets; smaller, more efficient government; and a stronger national defense. ", "In their new positions, they were briefed either by holdover appointees from the former liberal Administration or by career civil servants who, inevitably, had a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. ", "The discussion became quite animated as these Heritage board members recalled transitioning to government positions from their former lives in the private sector\u2014moving their families, finding new homes, and uprooting their children\u2019s education while they assumed new responsibilities in a very different environment. ", "Frank Shakespeare, who had headed the United States Information Agency during the Cold War, noted that electoral politics is what gets a President and Vice President elected and sent to Washington, but then policy politics is what they had to focus on to do the right thing once they got the big job. ", "Former Navy Secretary and Ambassador Bill Middendorf added that there must be a better way to prepare for real change in a more conservative direction in the political environment in Washington. ", "If a conservative candidate were to become the President-elect in just 16 months, what could be done by an outside group to prepare for these new opportunities? ", "The staff at Heritage took this idea on as a challenge, and it would become the defining policy decision in the early history of this upstart think tank. ", "Task forces of knowledgeable volunteers were formed with specific expertise in the whole range of policy issues\u2014from welfare reform to national defense reform. ", "The vision for Mandate for Leadership was that it would serve as a guidebook of specific policy recommendations for reducing the size and scope of the federal government and for ensuring that it stayed within its constitutional bounds. ", "Positive plans for freeing the private sector from overblown government interference and regulation could, we believed, result in an explosion of entrepreneurial activity that would reassert America\u2019s leading role in the world\u2019s economy. ", "Thus, if conservatives finally gained control in Washington, they were prepared to answer the question, \u201cWhat is the conservative agenda?\u201d ", "Candidate, then President-elect, then President Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cfeisty new kid on the conservative block\u2014The Heritage Foundation\u201d\u2014 had the answer, and it was Mandate for Leadership. ", "First published in January 1981, the original Mandate served as a conservative plan of action for the Reagan Administration, providing much of the blueprint for the Reagan Revolution. ", "It contained more than 2,000 detailed, actionable policy recommendations to move the federal government in a conservative direction. ", "The recommendations ranged from internal bureaucratic reorganizations to plans to implement specific, fundamental changes in every imaginable policy area\u2014 from tax and regulatory reform to strengthening national defense to reforming social programs. ", "All were carefully crafted, vetted, and pieced together. ", "On January 21, 1981, at the first meeting of his Cabinet, President Reagan distributed copies of Mandate, and many of the study\u2019s authors were recruited into the Administration to implement its recommendations. ", "In the foreword of that first edition, I wrote, \u201cWhat is offered by the authors is a series of proposals which, if implemented, will help revitalize our economy, strengthen our national security, and halt the centralization of power in the federal government.\u201d ", "The conservative movement had found in Ronald Reagan a President who shared that vision and who had the will to go against the established political grain in Washington. ", "He also had the ability to speak directly to the American people and convincingly show them how those ideas could work for the benefit of all. ", "Mandate\u2019s proven ideas and President Reagan\u2019s skill at communicating their benefits led to his Administration implementing almost half of the recommendations by the end of his first year in office. ", "Those recommendations led to tax cuts and other economic policies that gave America one of the longest periods of peacetime economic growth in its history\u2014with an annual growth rate that has not been rivaled since then. ", "The recommendations led to a rebuilding of the United States military, helped to bring an end to the Cold War and to the Soviet Union itself, and reinvigorated the American people with a collective sense of pride and patriotism that many thought had vanished forever. ", "After that first edition, a new Mandate was produced every four years. ", "But the 2016 edition was one of particular note. ", "It earned significant attention from the Trump Administration, as Heritage had accumulated a backlog of conservative ideas that had been blocked by President Barack Obama and his team. ", "Soon after President Donald Trump was sworn in, his Administration began to implement major parts of the 2016 Mandate. ", "After his first year in office, the Administration had implemented 64 percent of its policy recommendations. ", "As a result of those recommendations, the Trump Administration cut taxes and eliminated unnecessary regulations, creating a growing economy and the lowest unemployment rate in five decades\u2014including among minorities and women. ", "It made America a net energy exporter for the first time in half a century. ", "It also prioritized veterans\u2019 care and rebuilt our national defenses. ", "As I noted above, in his first year in office, President Reagan implemented nearly half of Mandate\u2019s recommendations\u2014an extraordinary feat. ", "In 2018, in an interview on Fox News, I mentioned that President Trump had implemented more recommendations in his first year than Ronald Reagan did in his. ", "Of course, at the time, Reagan did not have both a Republican House and Senate as Trump did. ", "Nonetheless, President Trump liked being compared to a former President he deeply admired, and he touted the comparison frequently. ", "This anecdote illustrates how Mandate provides a yardstick for conservative Presidents to measure their performance relative to one another. ", "And, very importantly, it allows the American people to see concrete evidence of the progress an Administration is making toward reversing the growth of government and implementing conservative solutions in its stead. ", "In essence, it allows the American people to hold their politicians accountable to the principles they profess to believe in. ", "When we were producing that first Mandate edition, we had suffered under four years of Jimmy Carter with double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, high unemployment, gasoline rationing, weakness overseas, and what Carter himself called a malaise that he had induced in the American people. ", "In the 1981 Mandate foreword, I wrote: ", "The full recovery of our nation in both the economic and foreign policy spheres will require the sustained application of sound policies over several years. ", "There are no \u201cquick fix\u201d solutions to problems that have been years in the making. ", "But no time must be lost in taking the first decisive steps on the road to recovery. ", "Today, President Joe Biden has brought us back to the days of Jimmy Carter\u2014 actually, even worse\u2014with full-bore economic, military, cultural, and foreign policy turmoil. ", "The advice that I wrote more than four decades ago just as easily could have been written today. ", "A conservative Administration coming on board in 2025 will need to hit the ground running just to undo the significant damage that will have been done during the Biden years. ", "Something that is essential to ensuring that a new President in 2025 can successfully implement a conservative agenda is having the right personnel to run the executive branch departments and their agencies. ", "This is why it is so often said that \u201cpeople are policy.\u201d ", "The Cabinet secretaries, deputy secretaries, undersecretaries, assistant secretaries, deputy assistant secretaries, administrators, agency heads, and on and on that a new President chooses to place throughout the executive branch must be principled individuals already aligned with the President\u2019s conservative vision. ", "And they must be willing to execute it on the President\u2019s behalf. ", "These personnel choices will ultimately determine the success or failure of the policy agenda and, hence, of the whole Administration. ", "Presidential appointees not only are critical to implementing the policy agenda, but also must serve to \u201cwatch the watchers\u201d in the departments and agencies they oversee. ", "They must ensure accountability as well as provide a check on the inherent nature of the administrative state to overreach its authority. ", "For example, they must rein in the Environmental Protection Agency, which declared backyard streams navigable waterways that then fall under its authority. ", "They must rein in the Internal Revenue Service, including its 87,000 new employees hired to pick through every detail of what Americans make and how they spend their money. ", "They must rein in agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which the Biden Administration weaponized to attempt to force COVID-19 vaccine mandates on 84 million Americans through their workplaces. ", "When these new presidential appointees come into office, it is often the career bureaucrats who end up orienting them to their new positions. ", "Many of these bureaucrats are all too comfortable with the status quo. ", "Appointees have only four years (eight at the most) to effect change and make a difference. ", "They need a road map to do that starting on Day One. ", "That road map is exactly what Mandate provides. ", "It is not a mandate to maintain the status quo but just do it a little more efficiently. ", "Rather, it is a mandate to significantly advance conservative principles in practice and demonstrate to the American people that where liberal policies generally fail, conservative solutions succeed in making life better for all of us. ", "From the original 1981 Reagan-era Mandate for Leadership to this edition for 2025, the purpose remains the same: to present concrete proposals to revitalize our economy, strengthen our national security, and halt the centralization of power in the federal government. ", "In Washington, there are no permanent victories. ", "But neither are there permanent defeats. ", "Rather, there are permanent battles throughout the policy arena. ", "The other side is never standing still. ", "While we may achieve tremendous successes under conservative leaders, the Left is always working to chip away at them, which is why we must constantly be prepared for the next fight. ", "That\u2019s why today, Heritage President Kevin Roberts, Project 2025 Director Paul Dans, the whole Heritage team, more than 50 organizations, and more than 360 experts from throughout the conservative movement have come together to continue the Mandate for Leadership tradition of creating policy solutions to solve the biggest issues facing America\u2014solutions based on the core principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense. ", "We do this not to expand government, grow its largesse for some special interest, or centralize more control in Washington. ", "Instead, we do this to build an America where freedom, opportunity, prosperity, and civil society flourish for all. ", "One final note: ", "As most readers know, this section of a book is usually called the \u201cAfterword,\u201d but we have decided to title it \u201cOnward!\u201d ", "In all the decades that I served as The Heritage Foundation\u2019s founder and president\u2014and to this day as a member of its Board of Trustees\u2014I have ended my communications with the exhortation \u201cOnward!\u201d ", "This has been my charge to encourage friends, colleagues, and allies that we must always be advancing.
